SRC_001,"Investigating the interaction between dietary polyphenols, the SARS CoV-2 spike protein and the ACE-2 receptor","Dorothea Schmidt, Inamullah Hakeem Said, Nicholas Ohl, Mobinasaddat Sharifii, Paula Cotrell, Nikolai Kuhnert",2022,Food &amp; Function,10.1039/d2fo00394e,https://doi.org/10.1039/d2fo00394e,"The global spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has called for an urgent need for the identification of compounds able to control, prevent or slow down the global pandemic. Several dietary polyphenols were assayed against binding to the SARS CoV-2 S1 spike protein and the human ACE-2 receptor, the target of the SARS CoV-2 virus using nano differential scanning fluorimetry, suggesting interaction of dietary polyphenols with both proteins. Following this initial screening the two dietary polyphenols with the strongest affinity were evaluated in a second functional binding assay. The assay was based on the thermophoresis of a fluorescently labelled spike protein and the ACE-2 receptor in the presence of dietary concentrations of the polyphenol in question. It could be experimentally shown that 5-caffeoyl quinic acid and epicatechin reduce the binding constant between SARS CoV-2 spike protein of the alpha variant and the ACE-2 receptor by a factor of ten. The finding could as well be applied to black tea and a coffee beverage with dietary 5-CQA concentrations for the alpha variant Spike protein. Hence it can be speculated that a cup of coffee reduces binding of the virus to its human target, therefore reducing the likelihood of infection with SARS CoV-2, acting as a virus entry-inhibitor.",crossref

Earlier in 1918, the influenza pandemic has completely changed the healthcare system and daily life. The episode of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2003 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) less than ten years later highlights the significant threat of coronaviruses to humans and confirms that the SARS outbreak was not an isolated incident. With the ever-increasing diversity of animal coronavirus species, especially within bats, the likelihood of recombination leading to future outbreaks is high, and the threat of potential pandemics is real as highly pathogenic coronaviruses continue to spill over from zoonotic sources into the human population. The SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and the ongoing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are the virulent pathogens that have crossed the species barrier from animals to humans and have associated disease severity and higher mortality. Nevertheless, the zoonotic spillover represents a global concern of public health burden associated with high morbidity and mortality. However, in this coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, the SARS-CoV-2 spillover events are linked to humans as accumulating evidence indicates the virus transmission by humans and establishing a person-to-person transmission chain. Given the high contagiousness and stability of the SARS-CoV-2 in the environment, it may lead to adaptation of the virus to the human host and poses the risk of sustained potential human-to-human transmission. These viral outbreaks have entirely changed human lives and responses to public health. COVID-19 pandemic opened new avenues of drug and vaccine development. The pandemic widely affected human lives, including trade, food, agriculture, education, and healthcare. The public healthcare system collapsed during pandemics across the globe and primarily due to a halt in global trade and the supply of medical utilities. The COVID-19 is not only a viral outbreak but also a failure of the healthcare system in developing and developed countries as well. The global health responses were unprecedented such as in vaccine development. COVID-19 pandemic also taught how an imbalance between human-animal habitats might turn into a nightmare.",crossref

In the last two decades, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have been recognized. It has long been demonstrated that MERS-CoV binds to dipeptidyl peptidase 4 and SARS-CoV binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. A “cytokine storm” is the main pathophysiology of aforementioned viruses. Infiltration of neutrophils at the site of the infection is a risk factor for the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome and death. The new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has infected more people than SARS-Cov and MERS-CoV as it can easily be transmitted from person to person. Epidemiological studies indicate that majority of individuals are asymptomatic; therefore, an effective and an efficient tool is required for rapid testing. Identification of various cytokine and inflammatory factor expression levels can help in outcome prediction. In this study we reviewed immune responses in SARS-CoV, Mers-CoV, and SARS-COV-2 infections and the role of inflammatory cells.</jats:p>",crossref

Therefore, we compared the performance of Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 (ACOV2) and Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S (ACOV2S) and Atellica IM SARS-CoV-2 Total (COV2T) and SARS-CoV-2 IgG (sCOVG) serological tests in this study.Methods: A total of 186 patient samples were used. For each test, we analyzed the positive rate of serological antibody tests, precision, linearity, and agreement among the four assays.Results: The positive rates of COV2T, sCOVG, and ACOV2S were high (81.7%–89.2%) in total, with those for ACOV2S being the highest, while those of ACOV2 were as low as 44.6%. This may be related to the high completion rate of vaccination in Korea. The repeatability and within-laboratory coefficients of variation were within the claimed allowable imprecision; however, further research is needed to establish an allowable imprecision at low concentrations. COV2T showed a linear fit, whereas sCOVG and ACOV2S were appropriately modeled with a nonlinear fit. Good agreement was found among COV2T, sCOVG, and ACOV2S; however, the agreement between ACOV2 and any one of the other methods was poor.Conclusions: Considering the different antigens used in serological SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays, the performance of the tested assays is thought to show no significant difference for the qualitative detection of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. </jats:p>",crossref
SRC_005,Antibody Found in Mice Neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1,Howard D. Larkin,2022,JAMA,10.1001/jama.2022.14711,https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2022.14711,"Researchers have identified an antibody that broadly neutralized all tested SARS-CoV-2 subvariants as well as SARS-CoV-1 in laboratory experiments and several SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern in mice. Because it targets a spike protein area that may be less affected by genetic variations, the newly discovered antibody could better retain potency against emerging SARS-CoV-2 subvariants and future coronaviruses, if developed into therapeutic products.

Most current SARS-CoV-2 therapeutic antibodies work by binding to proteins in the virus receptor binding domain (RBD) that target angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). This blocks the virus from attaching to ACE2 on host cell membranes. But as the virus has evolved, multiple genetic variations have altered the ACE2-binding proteins so much that most current antibodies no longer block them effectively.

By contrast, the recently discovered SW186 antibody binds to an outer RBD region that does not attach to ACE2. That this RBD area was conserved not only as SARS-CoV-2 evolved but also in the related SARS-CoV-1 suggests that it may control an important function likely to be conserved in future variants and SARS coronaviruses.

Researchers found SW186 by isolating a panel of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies from mice immunized with the viral spike protein. Laboratory tests showed that only SW186 and 1 other antibody neutralized all the SARS-CoV-2 variants tested, including HU-1, Alpha, Beta, Delta, Gamma, Lambda, Mu, and Omicron, though its potency against Omicron BA.2.12.1, BA.4, and BA.5 was reduced. SW186 also neutralized SARS-CoV-1.

SW186 greatly reduced SARS-CoV-2 Alpha, Beta, and Delta viral loads in the lungs of mice, and protected the lungs from viral damage and inflammatory cell infiltration. It also prevented body weight loss from the Delta variant.

“Further structure-based engineering of SW186 may lead to development of more broadly effective antibodies against the circulating and future SARS viruses,” the authors wrote in Science Immunology.",crossref
SRC_006,Editorial: SARS-CoV-2 in water,"Eiji Haramoto, Gertjan Medema, John Scott Meschke, Susan Petterson",2022,SARS-CoV-2 in Water,10.2166/9781789064445_ch1,https://doi.org/10.2166/wh.2022.001,"We are delighted to share with you our special issue on SARS-CoV-2 in water, specifically targeted towards our Journal readership. Cutting-edge studies and reviews on the water-related health aspects of SARS-CoV-2 have been contributed by our research community related to the potential risk of waterborne COVID-19 transmission, household water uses, and hygiene during the pandemic, and surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater.

RISK OF WATERBORNE TRANSMISSION Listen In the early days of the pandemic, when shedding of virus with faeces was identified, the most critical question that needed to be addressed was: Does SARS-CoV-2 in water and wastewater present a risk to human health? Could water-based exposures, for example to plumbing workers and wastewater treatment plant operators, present a transmission pathway that needs to be managed?

While several lines of evidence emerged, indicating that there is likely minimal risk via waterborne exposure (including the lack of epidemiological signal of cases amongst wastewater workers, the lack of evidence of infectious virus in wastewater, and the lack of evidence of SARS-CoV-2 persistence in water or wastewater), this topic is still frequently raised for discussion from various sectors of the community. Included in this special issue is an invited review by Professor Mark Sobsey on the risk of COVID19 via faecal waste, wastewater, and water exposures (Sobsey 2022). We would like to express our gratitude to Mark for taking the time to undertake this important review and document his perspective on the available evidence for the benefit of our readership.

Of course, scientific evidence grows rapidly with ongoing research efforts and there is a need to stay alert and open-minded should there be a need to revisit. With that in mind, we commend to you a study from Dey et al. (2022) investigating the potential role of amoebae in the environmental persistence of SARS-CoV-2 virus. Understanding the microbial ecology of water systems and the interaction between different microorganisms is of great value and is important for managing the waterborne risk of several pathogens (from SARS-CoV-2 or other RNA viruses) in the future.

HOUSEHOLD WATER USE AND COMPLIANCE WITH PUBLIC HEALTH ADVICE Listen Public health interventions to limit person-to-person transmission including stay-at-home orders, social distancing, and handwashing were implemented swiftly and globally at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, with varying degrees of success. As a result of these interventions, water usage patterns changed both due to stay-at-home orders and an increase in water demand for hand washing. The interaction between water availability and compliance with public health orders became the focus of interesting research.

Kumpel et al. (2022) investigated household water usage patterns in Hubballi-Dharwad, India during 2020–2021. One-quarter of all households reported insufficient water for handwashing, suggesting that the increased demand for water was not being met. Their results showed that water insecurity negatively affected a household's ability to adhere to protective public health measures during the COVID-19 pandemic and highlighted the importance of access to uninterrupted, on-premises water during public health emergencies.

When a household water supply is insufficient or interrupted, there is a need to leave the household to obtain an essential water supply. Leaving the home increases person-to-person interactions in the community, and this is exacerbated when needing to visit public water and sanitation facilities where physical distancing is often not possible. Denpetkul et al. (2021) report a quantitative risk assessment highlighting the risks of person-to-person spread within public toilet facilities.

Handwashing is a simple and effective hygiene measure. Biswas & Karmakar (2022) analysed data from a recent National Sample Survey for India to assess trends in handwashing across the country. They considered a very broad range of factors including caste, class, monthly expenditure, religion, together with water and sanitation access criteria. They showed clearly that handwashing throughout India is far from universal, and sections of the population with poor handwashing practices are relatively more vulnerable during the COVID-19 pandemic. Identification of these vulnerable sections of the population is of great value for intervention.

WASTEWATER SURVEILLANCE Listen While disease surveillance via analysis of wastewater is far from new, the rate of growth in the implementation of wastewater surveillance since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic has been extraordinary. Wastewater molecular biology has moved into the spotlight of the scientific arena, gaining attention, interest, and critique like never before. The importance of these activities for our research community, as well as for supporting the public health response to the pandemic, is reflected in the large number of papers in this special issue specifically focussing on wastewater surveillance.

Since the beginning of 2020, wastewater surveillance programmes have been implemented in 58 countries (COVIDPoops19 Dashboard|covid19wbec.org). Given this rapid global expansion of predominantly new programmes, Tlhagale et al. (2022) reported on the logistics, implementation, advantages, and limitations of national surveillance programmes. A range of countries were included with specific details on the situation in England, the Netherlands, Turkey, and South Africa. In all case studies, the aim of the surveillance programme was to provide scientific evidence regarding the trends in the circulation of SARS-CoV-2 in communities. Wastewater monitoring data has been recognised as an important thread of scientific evidence for public health authorities; however prior to the current pandemic, many decision-makers were unfamiliar with the science behind wastewater surveillance. The unique nature of molecular data coupled with the diversity of methods applied has meant that scientific details are not simple or trivial. This has presented a unique challenge for our scientific community needing to bridge the gap in translating our science for decision-making, accurately, quickly, and effectively. This is particularly addressed by Tlhagale et al. (2022) who comment that ‘communication and knowledge dissemination have been demanding and time-consuming for the researchers and scientists working on the topic in all four case studies, which shows an area to better prepare for and support in the future’.

In further support of research translation, we include an excellent review prepared by Hrudey & Conant (2022) drawing on their experience with the Canadian Water Network (CWN) Wastewater Coalition. Hrudey & Conant (2022) argue that appropriate interpretation of wastewater data for public health decision-makers requires an understanding of the importance of different knowns and unknowns. They seek to unpack these details by reviewing the literature regarding the strengths and limitations of wastewater surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 towards the goal of ensuring findings serve needs of public health authorities. In conclusion, it is noted that ‘Perhaps one of the enduring benefits from all of the WBS initiatives has been that it required and achieved extensive interdisciplinary collaboration between environmental scientists/engineers and public health professionals.’ This is a welcome and needed avenue of growth for our entire scientific community.

In addition to these broader reviews, this special edition includes a selection of important individual scientific studies from Brazil, Austria, Hungary, Australia, and Japan, with each touching on different key aspects of wastewater surveillance.

Barbosa et al. (2022) used their wastewater surveillance programme to assess trends in SARS-CoV-2-RNA in four vulnerable urban communities (informal settlements and low-income neighbourhoods) in metropolitan Sao Paulo. They were able to positively correlate new cases of COVID-19 with N1 viral loads from the two largest communities. This study provides important and detailed information regarding the performance of their analytical methods, a valuable addition to this high-quality scientific study. Barbosa et al. (2022) comment that ‘Poor sanitation conditions, water scarcity, hyper-dense dwellings, crowded household, lack of health care access, among other factors, make urban slums and other vulnerable communities major COVID-9 hotspots and relevant areas for application of wastewater surveillance.’ Limited studies have been reported in these contexts; however, many programmes are currently ongoing in several LMICs including Pakistan, Nepal, Malawi and Indonesia, and therefore we look forward to future publications in our journal.

Róka et al. (2022) demonstrated the use of wastewater surveillance as an efficient tool in tracing emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern in Hungary, with sewage data closely correlated with the clinical emergence of B.1.1.7 cases.

In Tyrol (a federal province of Austria), wastewater monitoring programme was initiated by health authorities. Daleiden et al. (2022) report on this programme and show how wastewater surveillance provided value as an early warning system; provided independent confirmation of temporal trends in COVID-19 prevalence; enabled the assessment of the effectiveness of measures, alerted about bursts of disease activity; and provided evidence for the absence of COVID-19.

Camphor et al. (2022) report data from Australia and illustrate the interpretation of wastewater data within a more traditional epidemiologic framework used for decision support by public health professionals. They calculate odds ratios (odds of a positive detection given case notifications in the catchment) and evaluate the performance of wastewater testing as a population-level diagnostic tool.

Finally, the case study from an urban community in Japan addresses the important issue of back-calculation, which refers to the process of quantitatively interpreting community disease prevalence from wastewater data. Many studies have sought to estimate the number of cases in the community from the reported number of genome copies in a wastewater sample. Zhu et al. (2022) review the uncertainty associated with estimating the number of cases in the catchment area using back-calculation and conclude that ‘at the current stage, the uncertainty associated with the wastewater viral load is still a great hindrance to reliable back-calculation’. Their results, however, demonstrate a strong correlation between virus detection and reported cases, which they argue may guide towards novel wastewater surveillance strategies.

PATH Listen PATH, with support from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, is delighted to sponsor this very important special issue on SARS-CoV-2 in water, which gathers articles highlighting the role that water plays in transmission, control, and surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 and reflects on the challenges encountered in different settings.

PATH is a global non-profit organisation dedicated to achieving health equity. We believe that wastewater-based surveillance and more broadly environmental surveillance can provide a cost-effective tool for disease surveillance in countries where clinical surveillance is severely hampered by limited resources and where the population get delayed access to vaccines. However, integrating non-sewered areas and the resulting variety of sample types in wastewater surveillance systems increases challenges in implementation with the interpretation of data. With funding from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the Global Innovation Fund, PATH is supporting groups in Indonesia, Malawi, Nepal, and Pakistan to set up and implement wastewater-based surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 and to estimate the costs and cost-effectiveness of environmental surveillance, which is essential for scale-up and buy-in by public health authorities.

PATH has been supporting water sanitation and hygiene (WASH) with several projects, and acknowledges the topics presented in this issue which highlight the importance of WASH in the control of the transmission of the disease and as a factor of inequities. We are also pleased to see the representation of articles presenting wastewater surveillance initiatives and use cases from high-income countries but also from low-resource settings, where wastewater surveillance could potentially have the greatest impact. Several articles discuss the challenges of interpreting wastewater data, highlighting some of the barriers to wastewater surveillance data-based public health decision-making. This is an issue that will need to be addressed to build momentum from the SARS-CoV2 pandemic.",crossref

We aim to research the morbidity, characteristics and potential risk factors of orofacial pain associated with COVID-19 pandemic in China from December 2022 to early 2023. A cross-sectional survey was conducted in Fujian Province, China. The demographic and characteristic data of the subjects were collected and analysed. A total of 1526 subjects responded to the survey. The morbidity of orofacial pain increased significantly before and after COVID-19 infection. (42.26% vs. 46.52%, P < .001) A total of 217 (14.22%) subjects with orofacial pain before COVID-19 infection reported the phenomenon of ""COVID-19 infection with orofacial pain"" (CIOP). Univariate and multivariate logistic regression showed that male (OR = 1.761, P < .001) and other symptoms of COVID-19 (OR = 1.494, P < .001) may be the risk factors for the aggravation of CIOP, while the time of first infection (OR = 0.580, P = .004) and preference for drinking tea or coffee (OR = 0.610, P = .003) may be the protective factors for the aggravation of CIOP. While, the subjects who did not concern about the spread of COVID-19 in oral treatment (OR = 0.639, P = .001), female (OR = 0.749, P = .03), education level (OR = 1.687, P < .001) and income level (OR = 1.796, P < .001), higher PSS-10 score (OR = 1.076, P < .001), and more drugs taken for infection (OR = 1.330, P < .001) were more willing to seek medical treatment. The morbidity of orofacial pain appears to have increased significantly due to the COVID-19 epidemic; a number of factors can influence the CIOP including gender, infection period, and beverage preference' psychological factors, gender, education and income level can also influence the intent to seek a dentist.",pubmed

This study aimed to assess parosmia with Self-Administered Odor Questionnaire for Parosmia (SAOQ-P), a modification of the widely used SAOQ in Japan. The primary objective was to assess the effectiveness of SAOQ-P in identifying parosmia symptoms and its potential integration into the clinical assessment process. The study also explored traditional olfactory test differences between patients with and without parosmia. Patients at Jikei Smell Clinic that presented between May 2022 and November 2022 were recruited and administered the SAOQ-P, which had an added question about changes in the perception of 20 daily odors compared to the original SAOQ. Traditional olfactory tests utilized T&T olfactometry and Open Essence. Of 279 patients, 81 had parosmia, while 198 did not exhibit parosmic symptoms. Parosmia prevalence was influenced by the cause of olfactory dysfunction, with post-infectious and post-COVID-19 patients showing higher parosmia rates. Among parosmia patients, 87% reported changes in their perception of at least one odor assessed by SAOQ-P, with coffee, stool, and perfume most commonly affected. Traditional olfactory tests showed no significant differences between parosmia and non-parosmia groups. The number of odors causing parosmia was negatively correlated with age. SAOQ-P offers a promising approach to assess and quantify parosmia symptoms, seamlessly integrating into clinical assessments. SAOQ-P identified parosmia in 87% of patients and revealed insights into triggering factors. Traditional olfactory tests' limitations underscore the need for more accurate, patient-centric diagnostic approaches for parosmia.",pubmed

We prospectively examined the associations of coffee and green tea consumption with the risk of COVID-19 among mRNA vaccine recipients during the epidemic of the Omicron variant. Participants were 2,110 staff (aged 18 to 76 years) of a large medical facility in Tokyo, who attended a serosurvey in June 2022, predominantly received ≥3 doses of vaccine, and were followed for COVID-19 until December 2022. Coffee and green tea consumption was ascertained via a questionnaire. COVID-19 was identified through the in-house registry. Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) of COVID-19 across the categories of beverage consumption. During 6 months of follow-up, 225 (10.6%) cases of COVID-19 were identified. Contrary to the expectation, higher consumption of coffee was associated with a significant increase in the risk of COVID-19; multivariable-adjusted HRs were 1.00 (reference), 0.92 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.62-1.35), 1.48 (95% CI, 0.99-2.22), and 1.82 (95% CI, 1.20-2.76) for <1 cup/day, 1 cup/day, 2 cups/day, and ≥3 cups/day, respectively (P trend = 0.003). Green tea consumption was not significantly associated with the risk of COVID-19. The association with coffee was attenuated if serologically detected infection was added to the cases.

These policies and their Stringency Index (SI) of more than 160 countries were systematically recorded in the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) data set. The SI is a summary measure of the overall strictness of these policies. However, the OxCGRT SI may not fully reflect the stringency levels of the restriction policies implemented in Korea. Korea implemented 33 COVID-19 restriction policies targeting 4 areas: public facilities, public events, social gatherings, and religious gatherings. This study aims to develop new Korea Stringency Indices (KSIs) that reflect the stringency levels of Korea's restriction policies better and to determine which government-implemented policies were most effective in managing the COVID-19 pandemic in Korea. The random forest method was used to calculate the new KSIs using feature importance values and determine their effectiveness in managing daily COVID-19 confirmed cases. Five analysis periods were considered, including November 01, 2020, to January 20, 2021 (Period 1), January 20, 2021, to June 27, 2021 (Period 2), November 01, 2020, to June 27, 2021 (Period 3), June 27, 2021, to November 01, 2021 (Period 4), and November 01, 2021, to April 24, 2022 (Period 5). Among the KSIs, public facilities in period 4, public events in period 2, religious gatherings in periods 1 and 3, and social gatherings in period 5 had the highest importance. Among the public facilities, policies associated with operation hour restrictions in cinemas, restaurants, PC rooms, indoor sports facilities, karaoke, coffee shops, night entertainment facilities, and baths or saunas had the highest importance across all analysis periods. Strong positive correlations were observed between daily confirmed cases and public facilities, religious gatherings, and public events in period 1 of the pandemic. From then, weaker and negative correlations were observed in the remaining analysis periods. The comparison with the OxCGRT SI showed that the SI had a relatively lower feature importance and correlation with daily confirmed cases than the proposed KSIs, making KSIs more effective than SI. Restriction policies targeting public facilities were the most effective among the policies analyzed. In addition, different periods call for the enforcement of different policies given their effectiveness varies during the pandemic.",pubmed

Sensory tests were performed remotely. Results indicated that healthy consumers perceived higher intensities in most of the sensory attributes (with the exception of Burnt-A, Bitter-T, Acid-T, and Astringent-T attributes) compared to consumers who presented mild and severe COVID-19. Therefore, consumers diagnosed with mild and severe COVID-19 had a higher discrimination power in the attributes smell, basic tastes, and flavor. Healthy consumers could only discriminate two attributes that correspond to basic flavors. Consumers with mild and severe COVID-19 diagnosis elicited the highest number of negatives emotions (such as bored, disgusted, worried, guilty, wild, and aggressive) and negative memories (disease, pain, death, hurt, obesity, conflict personal, addiction, stench poverty, and accident) than healthy consumers. It is concluded that there were no significant differences between the consumer panels for the identification of sensory attributes. However, P-Healthy consumers perceived the highest intensities in most sensory attributes compared to those in the PCOVID19-Mild and PCOVID19-Severe panels. Finally, consumers diagnosed with mild or severe COVID-19 used a higher number of emotions and memories than those of the healthy panel.

The seep fluid chemistry is unique for Cascadia and includes extreme enrichment of boron and lithium and depletion of chloride, potassium, and magnesium. We conclude that the fluids are sourced from pore water compaction and mineral dehydration reactions with minimum source temperatures of 150° to 250°C, placing the source at or near the plate boundary offshore Central Oregon. Estimated fluid flow rates of 10 to 30 cm s-1 are orders of magnitude higher than those estimated elsewhere along the margin and are likely driven by extreme overpressures along the plate boundary. Probable draining of the overpressured reservoir along the vertical Alvin Canyon Fault indicates the important role that such faults may play in the regulation of pore fluid pressure throughout the forearc in Central Cascadia.

However, the ability to accurately identify seismogenic deposits in Cascadia lakes remains untested. Earthquakes are known to disturb lake sediment which resettle to form clastic-rich, upward-fining graded deposits, however extreme erosional events are also capable of creating similar deposits. The goal of this research is to determine if ground motions from a Cascadia earthquake can be uniquely identified in the sedimentary record from Lower Squaw Lakes, Oregon, ~100 km east of the coast near the California/Oregon border. This location is ideal for this project because it is one of two lakes that were formed when a landslide dammed two streams at their confluence, creating an upper and lower lake. Upper Squaw Lake contains a published record of erosional events and continuously overflows into the lower lake near the outflow. Our strategy is to compare the historic chronology of known extreme events to the sedimentary record of disturbances contained in well-dated cores from Lower Squaw Lake that we assume contains a disturbance from the 1700AD Cascadia earthquake. Here we show that this deposit is unique in the historic portion of the record, with evidence of sustained, not necessarily strong, ground motions. Deposit characteristics suggest that the sediment is sourced either from liquefaction or settling of the rapidly built cobble/boulder delta, requiring a lower minimum ground motion to trigger as compared to sediment disturbed from the lake margin. This finding was unexpected, and will allow us to create an accurate earthquake chronology from the sedimentary record at this location, and provides a different way of evaluating clastic layers from less-sensitive settings and greater distances from the coast than previously thought possible.",crossref

               <jats:p>The Nootka fault zone (NFZ) divides the incoming Explorer and Juan de Fuca plates of the Cascadia subduction zone. Three months of seafloor monitoring using 33 ocean‐bottom seismometers off the west coast of Vancouver Island has allowed us to better understand the tectonic configuration and seismogenic characteristics of the NFZ. We have learned that the NFZ is comprised of northern and southern primary bounding faults, and several conjugate faults developed subperpendicular to the primary faults. Earthquakes typically occur over the depth ranges of 15–20 and 6–15 km along the primary bounding and conjugate faults, respectively. Focal mechanisms reveal that the most common modes of failure in this region are left‐lateral strike slip, with normal faulting occurring along the southwestern extent of the NFZ and thrust faulting to the northeast before the subduction front. Seismic tomography suggests that the oceanic Moho is at a depth of 12–14 km below sea level (10–12 km below seafloor) just seaward of the Cascadia deformation front, and that it deepens to 19 km (17 km below seafloor) approximately 20 km landward of the deformation front. Converted phase analysis illuminates four velocity‐contrasting interfaces with average depths below sea level deepening landward of the subduction front at ∼4–6, ∼6–9, ∼11–14, and ∼14–18  km. We interpret them as the sedimentary basement, upper–lower crust boundary, oceanic Moho, and the base of the highly fractured and seawater or mineral enriched veins within mantle. The precipitation of minerals such as quartz or the formation of talc, which is made possible by the intense degree of fracturing within the NFZ facilitating the infiltration of seawater, may reduce mantle velocities, as well as VP/VS ratios. The lack of seismicity observed along the interplate thrust zone in northern Cascadia may suggest that the megathrust fault is completely locked, consistent with prior studies.</jats:p>",crossref

I interpret this stratigraphic sequence as evidence for tectonic subsidence and abrupt paleotsunami inundation. Prior research at the southern marsh at Netarts Bay has correlated Cascadia Subduction Zone (CSZ) ruptures to the stratigraphic record with sediment cores that have a pattern of marsh soils overlain by a sharp contact to sand, transitioning to mud and then marsh soils again, bulk sample radiocarbon dating, and diatom analysis. Sediment cores collected at the ghost forest site show the same stratigraphic pattern indicative of CSZ related subsidence. I correlated ghost forest trees exposed along the bay with trees protruding from incised marsh stratigraphy with both differential GPS and lidar elevation measurements for several ghost forest trees. I collected a cross section slab from a buried ghost forest tree, sanded the slab, counted growth rings at a consistent decadal interval, and submitted select samples for C14 accelerator mass spectrometry age dating.

We infer a ∼2700-year history of Cascadia megathrust and other earthquakes from two small mountain lakes located 100 km inland of the coast near the California–Oregon border. We use the characteristics of a disturbance deposit in the historic portion of the sediment cores attributed to the 1700 CE Cascadia earthquake to identify Cascadia earthquake deposits downcore. This deposit is composed of light-colored silt sourced from the delta and has extended organic grading of the deposit tail and a basal contact with evidence of rapid loading or coseismic settling of silt into the organic sediment below. Eight deposits downcore have the characteristics of this deposit. An age–depth model suggests that six of these are temporal correlatives to the largest margin-wide marine turbidite event deposits from Goldfinger et al. (2012) (deposits T1 through T6), whereas the two deposits with some of the characteristics are potential correlatives of smaller deposits T5a and T5b. We use the characteristics of the lower of two deposits inferred to be the result of a crustal earthquake that occurred in 1873 CE to identify similar deposits downcore. As a result, temporal correlatives of T2a and T3a and smaller deposits in the marine record were identified as likely crustal fault earthquakes. These results suggest that small Cascadia landslide-dammed lakes from distances of 100 km inland of the coast with sufficient sedimentation rates (∼1–2 cm per decade) and mixed clastic and organic content may be good recorders of subduction earthquakes. Furthermore, southern Cascadia crustal earthquakes likely partially explain the more frequent earthquakes in southern Cascadia and suggest a previously unrecognized hazard in the region.</jats:p>",crossref

More than two decades of research now underlies a near consensus that a future large earthquake along the Cascadia subduction zone is inevitable. Significant uncertainty remains, however, regarding the magnitude of displacement in such an event as well as the spatial extent of rupture along the fault zone; both are key factors that directly influence earthquake magnitude, tsunami generation, and coastal impacts. Existing models of tsunami inundation, in particular, demonstrate the close linkage between rupture scenario and site-specific inundation at the scale of individual estuaries. Our team is in the initial phase of developing a project exploring rupture scenarios by looking seaward from selected estuaries along the coast. Looking seaward involves two components. First, we seek to characterize tsunami deposit thickness, sedimentology, and distribution in estuaries with a clear record of tsunami deposition to build hydrodynamic models for exploration of the range of flow conditions capable of delivering and distributing sediment into an estuary. Hydrodynamic models will be coupled to a fault-coupling model in an effort to test existing Cascadia subduction zone rupture scenarios. The second component centers on developing the scientific framework in consultation with coastal emergency managers, land use planners, and communities. This dimension of the study is an attempt to incorporate end-user input into the study design. Understanding how communities use data and existing tsunami hazard maps is a key step needed to develop next-generation tsunami inundation models and to increase coastal community resilience.",crossref

The session is opened by Bob Handley, who welcomes Andrew for his presentation. Andrew begins by explaining the collaborative nature of IMPACT, highlighting its connections with hospitals across 23 countries. He outlines the two main aims of the study: to assess the impact of COVID-19 on mortality in elective and trauma orthopedic surgeries and to identify risk factors for developing COVID after surgery.

The study included data from nine Scottish hospitals over a seven-week period during the onset of the pandemic and utilized a bespoke data collection tool to ensure data accuracy. Andrew shares key findings showing that patients who contracted COVID-19 postoperatively had significantly lower 30-day survival rates compared to those who did not. Notably, 91% of the COVID cases occurred postoperatively, primarily among trauma patients, with only a small percentage being elective surgeries.
Factors contributing to an increased risk of postoperative COVID-19 include age over 77 years, high ASA grade, and specific types of fractures. The presentation concludes with a brief discussion on IMPACT-Restart 2, which focuses on arthroplasty patients. Overall, Andrew suggests that while COVID mortality in the arthroplasty cohort was low, vulnerable patients may benefit from enhanced perioperative care.",crossref

The risk of appendicitis was evaluated after SARS-CoV-2 infection and SARS-CoV-2 vaccination compared with the risk in unvaccinated people by conducting a population-based cohort study in Sweden.

Some 9.5 million people aged 12 years and older were included, consisting of all residents on 1 January 2017, who were alive and still residing in the country on 27 December 20204. A total of 72 722 people with any record of appendicitis from 1 January 2017 to 26 December 2020 were excluded. The risk of appendicitis in 21-day risk periods after administration of the first, second, and third dose with BNT162b2, mRNA-1273, and AZD1222 was evaluated. In a complementary analysis, incident appendicitis within 21 days after SARS-CoV-2 infection, from 1 August 2020 to the end of study on 31 January 2022, was studied.

The primary outcome was the date of first record of appendicitis (ICD-10 discharge diagnosis K35 in inpatient care), and the secondary outcome was appendicitis and related disorders (ICD-10 codes K35–K37) in either inpatient or outpatient care5. In a sensitivity analysis, a stricter definition was used, including both a record of appendicitis and a procedure code for appendicectomy.

The analysis was adjusted for sex, age, history of cystic fibrosis, diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, antibiotic prescriptions, and SARS-CoV-2 infection. Poisson regression was used to estimate incidence rate ratios (IRRs) with 95 per cent confidence intervals, comparing rates in a 21-day interval after vaccination with rates in unvaccinated periods.

Background
COVID-19 is associated with increased risks of neurological and psychiatric sequelae in the weeks and months thereafter. How long these risks remain, whether they affect children and adults similarly, and whether SARS-CoV-2 variants differ in their risk profiles remains unclear.
Methods
In this analysis of 2-year retrospective cohort studies, we extracted data from the TriNetX electronic health records network, an international network of de-identified data from health-care records of approximately 89 million patients collected from hospital, primary care, and specialist providers (mostly from the USA, but also from Australia, the UK, Spain, Bulgaria, India, Malaysia, and Taiwan). A cohort of patients of any age with COVID-19 diagnosed between Jan 20, 2020, and April 13, 2022, was identified and propensity-score matched (1:1) to a contemporaneous cohort of patients with any other respiratory infection. Matching was done on the basis of demographic factors, risk factors for COVID-19 and severe COVID-19 illness, and vaccination status. Analyses were stratified by age group (age <18 years [children], 18–64 years [adults], and ≥65 years [older adults]) and date of diagnosis. We assessed the risks of 14 neurological and psychiatric diagnoses after SARS-CoV-2 infection and compared these risks with the matched comparator cohort. The 2-year risk trajectories were represented by time-varying hazard ratios (HRs) and summarised using the 6-month constant HRs (representing the risks in the earlier phase of follow-up, which have not yet been well characterised in children), the risk horizon for each outcome (ie, the time at which the HR returns to 1), and the time to equal incidence in the two cohorts. We also estimated how many people died after a neurological or psychiatric diagnosis during follow-up in each age group. Finally, we compared matched cohorts of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 directly before and after the emergence of the alpha (B.1.1.7), delta (B.1.617.2), and omicron (B.1.1.529) variants.
Findings
We identified 1 487 712 patients with a recorded diagnosis of COVID-19 during the study period, of whom 1 284 437 (185 748 children, 856 588 adults, and 242 101 older adults; overall mean age 42·5 years [SD 21·9]; 741 806 [57·8%] were female and 542 192 [42·2%] were male) were adequately matched with an equal number of patients with another respiratory infection. The risk trajectories of outcomes after SARS-CoV-2 infection in the whole cohort differed substantially. While most outcomes had HRs significantly greater than 1 after 6 months (with the exception of encephalitis; Guillain-Barré syndrome; nerve, nerve root, and plexus disorder; and parkinsonism), their risk horizons and time to equal incidence varied greatly. Risks of the common psychiatric disorders returned to baseline after 1–2 months (mood disorders at 43 days, anxiety disorders at 58 days) and subsequently reached an equal overall incidence to the matched comparison group (mood disorders at 457 days, anxiety disorders at 417 days). By contrast, risks of cognitive deficit (known as brain fog), dementia, psychotic disorders, and epilepsy or seizures were still increased at the end of the 2-year follow-up period. Post-COVID-19 risk trajectories differed in children compared with adults: in the 6 months after SARS-CoV-2 infection, children were not at an increased risk of mood (HR 1·02 [95% CI 0·94–1·10) or anxiety (1·00 [0·94–1·06]) disorders, but did have an increased risk of cognitive deficit, insomnia, intracranial haemorrhage, ischaemic stroke, nerve, nerve root, and plexus disorders, psychotic disorders, and epilepsy or seizures (HRs ranging from 1·20 [1·09–1·33] to 2·16 [1·46–3·19]). Unlike adults, cognitive deficit in children had a finite risk horizon (75 days) and a finite time to equal incidence (491 days). A sizeable proportion of older adults who received a neurological or psychiatric diagnosis, in either cohort, subsequently died, especially those diagnosed with dementia or epilepsy or seizures. Risk profiles were similar just before versus just after the emergence of the alpha variant (n=47 675 in each cohort). Just after (vs just before) the emergence of the delta variant (n=44 835 in each cohort), increased risks of ischaemic stroke, epilepsy or seizures, cognitive deficit, insomnia, and anxiety disorders were observed, compounded by an increased death rate. With omicron (n=39 845 in each cohort), there was a lower death rate than just before emergence of the variant, but the risks of neurological and psychiatric outcomes remained similar.
Interpretation
This analysis of 2-year retrospective cohort studies of individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 showed that the increased incidence of mood and anxiety disorders was transient, with no overall excess of these diagnoses compared with other respiratory infections. In contrast, the increased risk of psychotic disorder, cognitive deficit, dementia, and epilepsy or seizures persisted throughout. The differing trajectories suggest a different pathogenesis for these outcomes. Children have a more benign overall profile of psychiatric risk than do adults and older adults, but their sustained higher risk of some diagnoses is of concern. The fact that neurological and psychiatric outcomes were similar during the delta and omicron waves indicates that the burden on the health-care system might continue even with variants that are less severe in other respects. Our findings are relevant to understanding individual-level and population-level risks of neurological and psychiatric disorders after SARS-CoV-2 infection and can help inform our responses to them.

Our primary cohort comprised patients who had a COVID-19 diagnosis; one matched control cohort included patients diagnosed with influenza, and the other matched control cohort included patients diagnosed with any respiratory tract infection including influenza in the same period. Patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 or a positive test for SARS-CoV-2 were excluded from the control cohorts. All cohorts included patients older than 10 years who had an index event on or after Jan 20, 2020, and who were still alive on Dec 13, 2020. We estimated the incidence of 14 neurological and psychiatric outcomes in the 6 months after a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19: intracranial haemorrhage; ischaemic stroke; parkinsonism; Guillain-Barré syndrome; nerve, nerve root, and plexus disorders; myoneural junction and muscle disease; encephalitis; dementia; psychotic, mood, and anxiety disorders (grouped and separately); substance use disorder; and insomnia. Using a Cox model, we compared incidences with those in propensity score-matched cohorts of patients with influenza or other respiratory tract infections. We investigated how these estimates were affected by COVID-19 severity, as proxied by hospitalisation, intensive therapy unit (ITU) admission, and encephalopathy (delirium and related disorders). We assessed the robustness of the differences in outcomes between cohorts by repeating the analysis in different scenarios. To provide benchmarking for the incidence and risk of neurological and psychiatric sequelae, we compared our primary cohort with four cohorts of patients diagnosed in the same period with additional index events: skin infection, urolithiasis, fracture of a large bone, and pulmonary embolism. Among 236 379 patients diagnosed with COVID-19, the estimated incidence of a neurological or psychiatric diagnosis in the following 6 months was 33·62% (95% CI 33·17-34·07), with 12·84% (12·36-13·33) receiving their first such diagnosis. For patients who had been admitted to an ITU, the estimated incidence of a diagnosis was 46·42% (44·78-48·09) and for a first diagnosis was 25·79% (23·50-28·25). Regarding individual diagnoses of the study outcomes, the whole COVID-19 cohort had estimated incidences of 0·56% (0·50-0·63) for intracranial haemorrhage, 2·10% (1·97-2·23) for ischaemic stroke, 0·11% (0·08-0·14) for parkinsonism, 0·67% (0·59-0·75) for dementia, 17·39% (17·04-17·74) for anxiety disorder, and 1·40% (1·30-1·51) for psychotic disorder, among others. In the group with ITU admission, estimated incidences were 2·66% (2·24-3·16) for intracranial haemorrhage, 6·92% (6·17-7·76) for ischaemic stroke, 0·26% (0·15-0·45) for parkinsonism, 1·74% (1·31-2·30) for dementia, 19·15% (17·90-20·48) for anxiety disorder, and 2·77% (2·31-3·33) for psychotic disorder. Most diagnostic categories were more common in patients who had COVID-19 than in those who had influenza (hazard ratio [HR] 1·44, 95% CI 1·40-1·47, for any diagnosis; 1·78, 1·68-1·89, for any first diagnosis) and those who had other respiratory tract infections (1·16, 1·14-1·17, for any diagnosis; 1·32, 1·27-1·36, for any first diagnosis). As with incidences, HRs were higher in patients who had more severe COVID-19 (eg, those admitted to ITU compared with those who were not: 1·58, 1·50-1·67, for any diagnosis; 2·87, 2·45-3·35, for any first diagnosis). Results were robust to various sensitivity analyses and benchmarking against the four additional index health events. Our study provides evidence for substantial neurological and psychiatric morbidity in the 6 months after COVID-19 infection. Risks were greatest in, but not limited to, patients who had severe COVID-19. This information could help in service planning and identification of research priorities. Complementary study designs, including prospective cohorts, are needed to corroborate and explain these findings.

SRC_030,SARS-CoV-2 vaccination may help patients with persistent COVID-19 smell dysfunction,"Jerome R Lechien, Claire Hopkins, Luigi A Vaira, Sven Saussez",2021,"Ear, Nose &amp; Throat Journal",10.1177/01455613211044770,https://doi.org/10.1177/01455613211044770,"Olfactory dysfunction (OD) is recognized as a key symptom of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Early olfactory loss is due to injury to the olfactory epithelium, with the initial insult to sustentacular cells leading to loss of function of the olfactory sensory neurons and loss of cilia on the neurons.1,2 In most cases, neurons survive, sustentacular cells recover and olfaction improves in a few weeks following the COVID-19 infection.2 According to psychophysical evaluations, OD may last more than 6 or 12 months in 1 to 10% of cases;3-5 these patients are considered as having persistent hypo- or anosmia. The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the persistence of OD in patients with a history of COVID-19 remain unclear and poorly investigated. From a physiological standpoint, the spread of the virus into the olfactory bulb leads to lesions of sustentacular cells: the cells expressing angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2).6 Olfactory neurons poorly express the virus receptor or not at all.6 The regeneration of sustentacular cells occurs in few weeks7 and is clinically associated with the recovery of smell within that period. Considering these findings, the persistence of OD in some patients raises many questions about the pathophysiological mechanisms of OD. In this letter, we aim to propose a potential hypothesis based on some recent clinical observations.
Since the development of vaccination in Western countries, we observed that some patients with persistent COVID-19 OD recovered in the weeks following the administration of vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. Although it is currently difficult to demonstrate potential association between vaccination and smell recovery, some findings may support that persistent OD could be due to the persistence of virus in the olfactory epithelium and region.
Firstly, our team found that patients with poor olfactory outcomes at 60 days post–COVID-19 reported lower levels of salivary and nasal immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgG1, supporting a lower local immune response than in those who experienced rapid olfactory recovery.8 The differences in immune response between patients with persistent OD and those without OD were supported by the study of de Melo et al.9 In this study, authors observed, in a murine model, that SARS-CoV-2 induced acute anosmia and ageusia with both lasting as long as the virus remained in both the olfactory epithelium and bulb. Interestingly, they observed persistence of viral transcripts and of SARS-CoV-2–infected cells from olfactory mucosa sampling of patients with long-term persistence of anosmia.9 However, olfactory region abnormalities were observed in imaging study several months after the onset of OD, which may support the persistence of inflammatory reaction in patients who did not report COVID-19 general symptoms.10
According to these findings and our clinical observations, we believe that the persistence of OD in COVID-19 patients could be related to the persistence of the virus in the olfactory region, which induces a chronic inflammatory reaction characterized by the destruction of re-infected cells throughout the recovery process, that is, neuroepithelium cells, sustentacular cells and olfactory neurons. Interestingly, it has been supported that inflammation may suppress regeneration of the olfactory stem cells.11 In this way, we believe that the administration of vaccine may stimulate the local and systemic immune response against the virus, ‘cleaning’ the olfactory region from the remaining viruses, allowing the regeneration of stem cells. Future controlled studies are needed to compare the evolution of olfactory outcomes of patients with persistent OD according to the vaccine status of patients. Recent studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in immunologically privileged tissues, such as the testicles, without significant immune response.12 Further studies are needed to test the hypothesis that the olfactory bulb could be considered as an additional anatomical region not exposed to a significant immune response, allowing for persistence of SARS-CoV-2.",crossref

Initial outbreaks in China involved 13.8% of cases with severe courses, and 6.1% of cases with critical courses3. This severe presentation may result from the virus using a virus receptor that is expressed predominantly in the lung2,4; the same receptor tropism is thought to have determined the pathogenicity-but also aided in the control-of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 20035. However, there are reports of cases of COVID-19 in which the patient shows mild upper respiratory tract symptoms, which suggests the potential for pre- or oligosymptomatic transmission6-8. There is an urgent need for information on virus replication, immunity and infectivity in specific sites of the body. Here we report a detailed virological analysis of nine cases of COVID-19 that provides proof of active virus replication in tissues of the upper respiratory tract. Pharyngeal virus shedding was very high during the first week of symptoms, with a peak at 7.11 × 108 RNA copies per throat swab on day 4. Infectious virus was readily isolated from samples derived from the throat or lung, but not from stool samples-in spite of high concentrations of virus RNA. Blood and urine samples never yielded virus. Active replication in the throat was confirmed by the presence of viral replicative RNA intermediates in the throat samples. We consistently detected sequence-distinct virus populations in throat and lung samples from one patient, proving independent replication. The shedding of viral RNA from sputum outlasted the end of symptoms. Seroconversion occurred after 7 days in 50% of patients (and by day 14 in all patients), but was not followed by a rapid decline in viral load. COVID-19 can present as a mild illness of the upper respiratory tract. The confirmation of active virus replication in the upper respiratory tract has implications for the containment of COVID-19.",pubmed

The capital of this district is the city of Codogno where on February 21, 2020, the first case of COVID-19 (Corona Virus Disease 2019) was diagnosed in Italy. The etiological agent is known to be a new coronavirus called SARS Cov-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome – Coronavirus – 2). Even asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic patients can transmit the virus and contribute to the expansion of the infection. From 21 February 2020, we have noticed a significant increase of anosmia cases in the population of Codogno and we believe there may be a relationship with the SARS-Cov 2 infection.

Methods: In the period between 21 February and 15 March 2020, we described 27 patients, living in Codogno, with anosmia. We calculated the incidence of the anosmia symptom in our patients in the period following the first diagnosis of COVID- 19 in Italy (February 21, 2020/March 15, 2020) and then compared it to the incidences relating to the same period of the years 2019 and 2018 and to the incidences in other periods from 1 January 2018. We then analysed the results through test χ2 in order to verify a statistical significance in the results.

Results: We observed a statistically significant increase in the incidence of the anosmia symptom in the period between 21 February and 15 March of 2020 compared to the incidence of the same symptom in other periods

Conclusion: The interpretation of the results leads us to argue that anosmia may be a symptom related to SARS-Cov2 infection. This symptom could be significant in paucisymptomatic patients who represent a potential viral transmission reservoir. In this regard, in this age of pandemic, when doctors observe patients with anosmia, they should consider SARS-Cov 2 infection in the differential diagnosis.",crossref

SRC_035,"Forensic medicine in the time of COVID 19: An Editorial from Milano, Italy",Cristina Cattaneo,2020,Forensic Science International,10.1016/j.forsciint.2020.110308,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.forsciint.2020.110308,"We live in a time where forensic medicine and science in most societies are perceived as of paramount importance for the assistance of justice and the safeguard of human rights. Many of us have the fortune to live in countries or regions where wealth, politics and well being in general are sufficiently stable to guarantee a more or less straightforward practice of our profession. Hence most of us have never imagined how a pandemic, such as the present COVID 19 one, could severely jeopardize the possibility of putting our work at the service of society, be it in the realm of forensic pathology, forensic sciences in general or clinical forensic medicine. We have spent years if not decades envisaging catastrophies of quite a different nature, preparing protocols for properly recovering and identifying victims, reconstructing manner of death and collecting evidence in scenarios which span from explosions to tsunamis, from mass disasters, to single cases of voluntary homicide, child abuse, or manslaughter; but today our discipline too seems almost helpless in front of the paralysing effect of a 30-kilobase virus. The Metropolitan city of Milano with its population of 3 million is the largest in the Region of Lombardy (population 10 million), and Lombardy is the area which has been most severely hit by COVID 19. In less than two months there have been over 62,000 cases, with over 11,000 COVID related deaths [1]. The Regional Health Service (one of the most efficient in the country from a clinical perspective) quickly reached saturation under such extreme stress, with worrying shortage of beds not only in infectious and respiratory disease wards but especially in intensive care units. At least four new hospital facilities have been developed in the region during this time to meet these needs. Shortage of swabs for COVID 19 RNA testing, saturimeters, protective gear such as gloves, goggles and masks has quickly become critical also, as well as scarcity of healthcare specialists, forcing the system to provisionally recruit new personnel [2] and in particular medical doctors with a specialisation in crucial branches of medicine such as intensive care therapy, radiology, respiratory diseases etc., as well as doctors training in these and other areas: of these professionals, 78 in the Region and over 130 in all of Italy have fallen victims of COVID 19 (along with 28 and 34 nurses respectively) [3]. Many other countries, to a smaller or greater extent, are suffering in the same delirious scenario. What does this all mean for forensic sciences and medicine? This is an account of the reality of Milano, which has one of the largest morgue facilities for medicolegal purposes (between 800–1000 cases per year) on the national territory; but an exchange of views with several European colleagues in some cases has confirmed similar experiences elsewhere. In less than 2 months, medico legal autopsies have drastically decreased, by 70% [4]. For reasons related to several variables (mainly the fact that the system is generally under pressure, but also to lack of protective equipment in some cases, in other cases inadequacy of forensic autopsy rooms in guaranteeing sufficient negative pressure or other fundamental prerequisites for the safeguard of environmental and operator health) full medicolegal autopsies are not being performed except for extreme circumstances, and frequently with targeted dissection (only to the extent necessary) and percutaneous sampling of fluids, as mentioned in several protocols available from across the world [5,6]. In many cities across Lombardy and Italy, University and hospital morgues had been potentiated in preparation for disasters such as terrorist bombings, in order to accomodate a large number of victims, and for technically complex situations which were to be challenging under the perspective of size (quantity of victims), trauma, taphonomy; therefore, for example, large numbers of cold storage rooms and fridge-cells, as well as radiological facilities were implemented. Very few had thought of logistics for microbiologically challenging (at least more challenging than forensic routine) medico legal activity, the tendency being in “normal” times to send such rare cases to specific pathological facilities in hospitals specialised in infectious diseases: at the moment, because of the scale of the tragedy, this is unthinkable. We know from the Prosecutor’s Office in the city [7] that criminal proceedings related to traffic and occupational deaths have actually decreased with respect to normality for reasons related to limited work access and mobility; nonetheless cases of suicide and voluntary homicide have not. Therefore this forced reduction in medicolegal activity will somehow affect the justice system. The large daily number of dead has almost completely saturated the city morgue’s storage capacity and that of smaller hospitals and the sight of rows of coffins is one we had grown unaccustomed to since the large disasters involving migration across the Mediterranean in the years 2013–2017. However something very similar to ambiguous loss, a frequent companion of forensic cases, is reappearing. Ambiguous loss is defined as a situation of unclear loss resulting from not knowing whether a loved one is dead or alive [8], which results in depression and other serious conditions. In many COVID 19 cases, relatives, for a series of reasons related to quarantine and emergency dispositions, saw their loved one for the last time two weeks before he or she died in hospital and was quickly buried due to the emergency situation. Not being able to see the body or to take part in a public ritual (such as a funeral) is already showing its effects. More worrying news comes from our front of clinical forensic medicine, in other words from the forensic practitioners who provide clinical medico legal services for living victims. Milano has a centre for sexual assault and domestic violence (SVS &D – Soccorso Violenza Sessuale e Domestica) which every year admits 1100 victims (adults, adolescents and children) of rape, maltreatment and abuse. In the past weeks, during our lockdown, victims seeking assistance (which in the case of the SVS&D centre is clinical, psychological, forensic and social) decreased by circa 50% [9], as did formal complaints, which means that the more vulnerable parts of society are not or cannot seek help and protection (not only forensic), again because of restrictions on mobility and/or because of the fact that most of these centres are within hospitals, and therefore impracticable. In this same period, the Governmental Help line for victims of stalking and domestic violence has reported a drastic increase in requests for help [10] almost three times as many as in the same period last year (from 397 in April 2019 to 1037 in April 2020). Given what we are seeing on the clinical side, in all these cases proper forensic documentation, sampling, evidence collection and interpretation will be missing, let alone proper clinical and psychological treatment of trauma. Things are equally preoccupying if we consider the forensic humanitarian front with medico legal activity having been frozen for asylum seekers and unaccompanied minors, as well as for individuals deprived of personal freedom, the unidentified dead and their loved ones still searching for them (in these days, on April 18th, falls the fifth anniversary of the largest migrant shipwreck in the Mediterranean and hundreds are still to be identified). Therefore, paradoxically, at a moment where crimes and needs of this sort are increasing we are somehow incapable of assisting. In the past week, the number of cases of law suits for medical malpractice, or more generally concerning the liability of medical administrators in relation to the spreading of disease and death, has largely increased due to complaints concerning COVID related deaths in hospitals or at home, inadequate medical assistance in non COVID emergencies, and the drastic increase of deaths in nursing homes and homes for the elderly. Medicolegal professionals will most likely be recruited in the near future by the Prosecution (and the defences) to examine medical records, collect samples from the dead for evidence of infection and disease, search for comorbidity and enter the enormous beehive of proving (where possible) if the person contracted COVID 19, whether he or she died of COVID 19 or with COVID 19, and what exactly the causal role of the 30-kilobase virus was. Teaching of forensic disciplines and forensic medicine (and of everything else) at University has also changed in a manner destined to last for quite a while: lectures, examinations and graduations are all to be held online, with the imaginable mishaps and problems this entails. Forensic research labs are mostly closed at the moment, with obvious consequences on services and research - although the present lockdown seems to have – momentarily only – led to an increase in article submissions to our journal. It may seem banal and trivial to say that this pandemic has indeed affected the world of forensics, at least in some areas: in fact, what hasn’t it affected? Our lives in many ways will probably change for a long time. When in war (and this from a certain perspective is a war, though “real” wars entail even more critical consequences) what is urgent in the acute phase is to save and protect life and health. But for the prolonged state of the emergency, which we will most certainly be confronted with, we should probably keep in mind that forensics also, certainly more indirectly than clinical disciplines, “saves lives”, protects and prevents, if applied and managed correctly, through a proper scientific assessment of death, crime and violence in general. If all this fails or somehow fades, the aftermath may be dangerous. Fortunately, a wave of reaction and response to this is already moving within the forensic community. Some authors [11] are now suggesting how we must, each in our own legal and social reality, find for the near future ways and safe compromises in order to continue performing medico legal examinations of the dead. The same effort must also be made for clinical forensic medicine and the living. As with all catastrophies, this one too will provide us with the occasion to open our world to new lines of thinking and even of forensic and medico legal research, perhaps leading to an amelioration of some systems once we will have paid the economical consequences. It is a bit too early to sum up what effect all this will truly have on forensics: these few lines are simply food for thought at a critical time.",crossref

We aimed to identify subphenotypes of ARDS patients undergoing prone positioning using machine learning and assess their association with mortality and response to prone positioning. In this retrospective observational study, we enrolled 353 mechanically ventilated ARDS patients who underwent at least one prone positioning cycle. Unsupervised machine learning was used to identify subphenotypes based on respiratory mechanics, oxygenation parameters, and demographic variables collected in supine position. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality. Secondary outcomes included response to prone positioning in terms of respiratory system compliance, driving pressure, PaO2/FiO2ratio, ventilatory ratio, and mechanical power. Three distinct subphenotypes were identified. Cluster 1 (22.9% of whole cohort) had a higher PaO2/FiO2ratio and lower Positive End-Expiratory Pressure (PEEP). Cluster 2 (51.3%) had a higher proportion of COVID-19 patients, lower driving pressure, higher PEEP, and higher respiratory system compliance. Cluster 3 (25.8%) had a lower pH, higher PaCO2, and higher ventilatory ratio. Mortality differed significantly across clusters (p = 0.03), with Cluster 3 having the highest mortality (56%). There were no significant differences in the proportions of responders to prone positioning for any of the studied parameters. Transpulmonary pressure measurements in a subcohort did not improve subphenotype characterization. Distinct ARDS subphenotypes with varying mortality were identified in patients undergoing prone positioning; however, predicting which patients benefited from this intervention based on available data was not possible. These findings underscore the need for continued efforts in phenotyping ARDS through multimodal data to better understand the heterogeneity of this population.",pubmed

EuroECMO-COVID is a prospective, observational study including adults (aged ≥16 years) requiring ECMO respiratory support for COVID-19 from 98 centres in 21 countries. We compared patient characteristics and outcomes between in-hospital survivors and non-survivors. Mixed-effects multivariable logistic regressions were used to investigate factors linked to in-hospital mortality. 6-month survival and overall patient status were determined via patient contact or chart review. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04366921, and is complete. We included 3860 patients (2687 [69·7%] were male and 1169 [30·3%] were female; median age 51 years [SD 11]) from 98 centres in 21 countries. In-hospital mortality was 55·9% (n=2158), with 81·2% (n=1752) deaths occurring during ECMO support. More non-survivors had diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and renal failure, and required more pre-ECMO inotropes and vasopressors compared with survivors. Median support duration was 18 days (IQR 10-31) for both groups. Factors linked to in-hospital mortality included older age, pre-ECMO renal failure, pre-ECMO vasopressors use, longer time from intubation to ECMO initiation, and complications, including neurological events, sepsis, bowel ischaemia, renal failure, and bleeding. Of the 1702 (44·1%) in-hospital survivors, 99·7% (n=1697) were alive at 6 months follow-up. Many patients at 6 months follow-up had dyspnoea (501 [32·0%] of 1568 patients), cardiac (122 [7·8%] of 1568 patients), or neurocognitive (168 [10·7%] of 1567 patients) symptoms. Our data for patients undergoing ECMO support for respiratory distress from the second COVID-19 wave onwards confirmed most findings from the first wave regarding patient characteristics and factors correlated to in-hospital mortality.

To examine through a systematic review with meta-analysis the characteristics of randomised trials on VDS to COVID-19 patients and admission to intensive care unit (ICU), and of randomised trials on VDS for the prevention of ARI. A systematic search retrieved randomised trials on VDS to COVID-19 patients and admission to ICU. Data on VDS and ARI were extracted from the meta-analysis of Jolliffe et al. 2021. Groups were formed including trials with total numbers of patients below or above the median size of all trials. The associations between VDS vs no VDS, and admission to ICU were evaluated using random-effects models from which summary odds ratios (SOR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were obtained. Meta-analyses were done for all trials and for each group of trials, which allowed testing a possible effect modification of trial size. Publication bias was assessed using the Louis-Furuya-Kanaruori (LFK) index (no bias if index between -1 and +1) and the trim and fill method. Nine trials on VDS for preventing admission to ICU were identified, including 50 to 548 patients.

The functional assessment of patients will be also performed at the end of ICU stay and at hospital discharge. The primary outcome is to estimate the prevalence of brachial plexus injury in patients with ARDS placed in the swimmer position during prone ventilation. Secondary outcomes will also include the safety of the manoeuvre by evaluation of all adverse events classified as skin or ocular damage, loss of tube and vascular access and new pressure ulcers.

SRC_044,VOE: automated analysis of variant epitopes of SARS-CoV-2 for the development of diagnostic tests or vaccines for COVID-1,"Danusorn Lee, Unitsa Sangket",2024,PeerJ,10.7717/peerj.17504,https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.17504/table-5,"Background
The development of serodiagnostic tests and vaccines for COVID-19 depends on the identification of epitopes from the SARS-CoV-2 genome. An epitope is the specific part of an antigen that is recognized by the immune system and can elicit an immune response. However, when the genetic variants contained in epitopes are used to develop rapid antigen tests (Ag-RDTs) and DNA or RNA vaccines, test sensitivity and vaccine efficacy can be low.

Methods
Here, we developed a “variant on epitope (VOE)” software, a new Python script for identifying variants located on an epitope. Variant analysis and sensitivity calculation for seven recommended epitopes were processed by VOE. Variants in 1,011 Omicron SRA reads from two variant databases (BCFtools and SARS-CoV-2-Freebayes) were processed by VOE.

Results
A variant with HIGH or MODERATE impact was found on all epitopes from both variant databases except the epitopes KLNDLCFTNV, RVQPTES, LKPFERD, and ITLCFTLKRK on the S gene and ORF7a gene. All epitope variants from the BCFtools and SARS-CoV-2 Freebayes variant databases showed about 100% sensitivity except epitopes APGQTGK and DSKVGGNYN on the S gene, which showed respective sensitivities of 28.4866% and 6.8249%, and 87.7349% and 71.1177%.

Conclusions
Therefore, the epitopes KLNDLCFTNV, RVQPTES, LKPFERD, and ITLCFTLKRK may be useful for the development of an epitope-based peptide vaccine and GGDGKMKD on the N gene may be useful for the development of serodiagnostic tests. Moreover, VOE can also be used to analyze other epitopes, and a new variant database for VOE may be further established when a new variant of SARS-CoV-2 emerges.

Real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) is currently the standard for SARS-CoV-2 detection. Although various nucleic acid-based assays have been developed to aid the detection of SARS-CoV-2 from COVID-19 patient samples, the objective of this study was to develop a diagnostic test that can be completed in 30 minutes without having to isolate RNA from the samples. Here, we present an RNA amplification detection method performed using reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) reactions to achieve specific, rapid (30 min), and sensitive (<100 copies) fluorescent detection in real-time of SARS-CoV-2 directly from patient nasopharyngeal swab (NP) samples. When compared to RT-qPCR, positive NP swab samples assayed by fluorescent RT-LAMP had 98% (n = 41/42) concordance and negative NP swab samples assayed by fluorescent RT-LAMP had 87% (n = 59/68) concordance for the same samples. Importantly, the fluorescent RT-LAMP results were obtained without purification of RNA from the NP swab samples in contrast to RT-qPCR. We also show that the fluorescent RT-LAMP assay can specifically detect live virus directly from cultures of both SARS-CoV-2 wild type (WA1/2020), and a SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 (alpha) variant strain with equal sensitivity to RT-qPCR. RT-LAMP has several advantages over RT-qPCR including isothermal amplification, speed (<30 min), reduced costs, and similar sensitivity and specificity.

Here, we describe the emergence of a new variant, with the index case returning from travel in Cameroon. For 13 SARS-CoV-2-positive patients living in the same geographical area of southeastern France, a qPCR test for screening variant-associated mutations showed an atypical combination. The genome sequences were obtained by next-generation sequencing with Oxford Nanopore Technologies on GridION instruments within about 8 h. Analysis revealed 46 nucleotide substitutions and 37 deletions, resulting in 30 amino acid substitutions and 12 deletions. Fourteen of the amino acid substitutions, including N501Y and E484K, and nine deletions are located in the spike protein. This genotype pattern led to the establishment of a new Pangolin lineage, named B.1.640.2, that is a phylogenetic sister group to the old B.1.640 lineage, which has now been renamed B.1.640.1. The lineages differ by 25 nucleotide substitutions and 33 deletions. The combination of mutations in these isolates and their phylogenetic position indicate, based on our previous definition, that they represent a new variant, which we have named “IHU”. These data are a further example of the unpredictability of the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants, and of their possible introduction into a given geographical area from abroad.</jats:p>",crossref

We questioned whether this is a general phenomenon following coronavirus passage to humans from another species, most often bats. We studied SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, and the four coronaviruses endemic in humans for several years or decades and observed gene degradation after species jumps from animals to humans. For SARS-CoV-2, we observed the progressive disappearance of its ORF8 with one or several stop codons and partial or even complete deletions, which is reminiscent of the 'Cheshire cat phenomenon' described in the L.

The N-terminal domain (NTD), which controls the initial attachment of the virus to lipid raft gangliosides, has not received the attention it deserves. In this study, we combined molecular modeling and physicochemical approaches to analyze the mode of interaction of ivermectin with the interface of the NTD-facing lipid rafts of the host cell membrane. We characterize a binding area that presents point mutations and deletions in successive SARS-CoV-2 variants from the initial strain to omicron KP.3 circulating in many countries in 2024. We show that ivermectin has exceptional flexibility, allowing the drug to bind to the spike protein of all variants tested. The energy of interaction is specific to each variant, allowing a classification according to their affinity for ivermectin in the following ascending order: Omicron KP.3 < Delta < Omicron BA.5 < Alpha < Wuhan (B.1) < Omicron BA.1. The binding site of ivermectin is subject to important variations of the NTD, including the Y144 deletion. It overlaps with the ganglioside binding domain of the NTD, as demonstrated by docking and physicochemical studies. These results suggest a new mechanism of antiviral action for ivermectin based on competitive inhibition for initial virus attachment to lipid rafts. The current KP.3 variant is still recognized by ivermectin, although with an affinity slightly lower than the Wuhan strain.",pubmed

Despite the presence of the virus in Mauritania, only one study described its genomic variation during the course of the epidemic. The purpose of the present study was to document the genomic pattern of SARS-CoV-2 variants from clinical isolates during the COVID-19 outbreak in Mauritania, from September to November 2021. The whole genomes from 54 SARS-CoV-2 strains detected in nasopharyngeal swabs with a cycle threshold value ≤ 30 were successfully sequenced using next-generation sequencing (NGS) and the Illumina protocol. The mean genome coverage (±standard deviation) was 96.8% (±3.7). The most commonly identified clade was 21J (57.4%), followed by 21D (16.7%), 20A (11.1%), and 20B (9.2%). At the level of lineages, the majority of the samples were Delta variants with the sub-lineage AY.34 (or B.1.617.2.34). Among the 54 SARS-CoV-2 isolates that were successfully sequenced, 33 (61.1%) came from vaccinated individuals, and 21 (38.9%) were from unvaccinated individuals. Several SARS-CoV-2 variants were present in Mauritania between September and November 2021. As Mauritania, like many West African countries, is resource-limited regarding viral genome sequencing facilities, establishment of mutualized sub-regional sequencing platforms will be necessary to ensure continuous monitoring of mutations in viral genomes and track potential reduction in COVID-19 vaccine efficacy, increased transmissibility, and disease severity.",pubmed

Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines are administered the most within the United States, and facial paralysis is one of the adverse events found after receiving the vaccines. The primary aim of the paper is to develop a predictive model which uses the features of vaccine receivers to predict whether facial paralysis would emerge as an adverse effect. Four predictive modes trained by undersampled and oversampled data from the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) are developed using logistic regression and decision tree from the last quarter of 2021, and features are selected using chi-square statistics. The four performance metrics (accuracy, recall, precision, and F1 score) indicate the incapability of models in making decisions, which also implies the irrelevance of selected features. However, the associations between selected features and t he high-level anxiety of the general public have in receiving vaccines under the pandemic are worth further research and physicians to study and explore for a more comprehensive understanding of the adverse events of COVID-19 vaccines, manufactured by Pfizer/BioNTech specifically. This paper finds that four performance metrics indicate these models are not capable of making sensitive predictions, which implies the irrelevance of the selected features and getting facial paralysis after receiving Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines. However, the connections between selected features and the huge amount of cases reported within a year reveal the high level of anxiety that the general public has in receiving vaccines under the pandemic.",crossref

This report details a clinical case of MBC where palbociclib was co-administered with letrozole. The integration of allogeneic tumor vaccination to this treatment led to heightened interferon-γ production, expansion of CD8+ and NK cell populations, and positive delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions, indicating successful development of anti-tumor immunity. The induced production of interferon-γ by tumor vaccination was associated with manageable modulation of sensitivity to palbociclib-letrozole therapy. Administration of the BioNTech/Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine compromised the anti-tumor immune response by reducing cytotoxic cell populations and increasing immunosuppressive cytokine production. The patient undergoing combined treatment achieved a progressive-free survival of 42 months. Incorporating active tumor vaccination with CDK4/6 inhibitor therapy presents a feasible approach for metastatic breast cancer.

In this study, we aimed to demonstrate the risk reduction of MIS-C and severe MIS-C after Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccination. This nationwide cohort study included 526,685 PCR-confirmed COVID-19 cases (age < 19 years), of whom 14,118 were fully vaccinated prior to COVID-19 infection. MIS-C cases were collected from all hospitals in Israel from April 2020 through November 2021. The MIS-C rates were calculated among two COVID-19 populations: positive PCR confirmed cases and estimated COVID-19 cases (PCR confirmed and presumed). Vaccination status was determined from Ministry of Health (MoH) records. The MIS-C risk difference (RD) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) between vaccinated and unvaccinated patients are presented. Overall, 233 MIS-C cases under the age of 19 years were diagnosed and hospitalized in Israel during the study period. Among the estimated COVID-19 cases, MIS-C RD realistically ranged between 2.1 [95%CI 0.7-3.4] and 1.0 [95%CI 0.4-1.7] per 10,000 COVID-19 cases. For severe MIS-C, RD realistically ranged between 1.6 [95%CI 1.3-1.9] and 0.8 [95%CI 0.7-1.0], per 10,000 COVID-19 cases. Sensitivity analysis was performed on a wide range of presumed COVID-19 rates, demonstrating significant RD for each of these rates. This research demonstrates that vaccinating children and adolescents against COVID-19 has reduced the risk of MIS-C during the study period. • Most of the published literature regarding vaccine effectiveness is based on case-control studies, which are limited due to small sample sizes and the inability to fully estimate the risk of MIS-C among vaccinated and unvaccinated children and adolescents. • The known underestimation of COVID-19 diagnosis among children and adolescents is challenging, as they often have few to no symptoms. • Significant risk difference was found in favor of the vaccinated group, even after including extreme assumptions regarding the underdiagnosed COVID-19 rate. • During this nationwide study period, it was found that vaccinating children and adolescents reduced the risk of MIS-C and its complications.",pubmed

Allergy-related disorders were suspected to be significant risk factors and the excipient polyethylene glycol was suggested to be a robust allergen. This is a retrospective study analysis. Subjects with putative risk factors for severe allergic reactions to the Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2 vaccine were referred for vaccination under observation at the Unit of Allergy and Clinical Immunology. Data was collected for each subject, including demographic details, medical history and previous reactions to any allergen. When appropriate, skin tests were done prior to vaccination. A total of 346 subjects received 623 vaccine doses under observation. The study included patients with various allergy-related disorders (n=290) and those with allergy to a previous COVID-19 vaccine dose (n=56). Both groups showed female predominance (78% and 88%, p=NS). Patients without reactions to previous doses reported more drug allergy (80% vs. 39%, p<0.001) and previous anaphylaxis (64% vs. 14%, p<0.001). There was no difference in sensitivity to other allergens, including polyethylene glycol. Under observation, mild allergic reactions were noted in 13 individuals characterized by female gender (100%), a history of anaphylaxis (69%) and drug allergy (62%). In 7 subjects, allergy was treated with antihistamines while others recovered spontaneously.

Nevertheless, the absence of sufficient vaccine safety information is one of the key contributors to vaccine refusal. We aimed to assess the short-term safety profile of the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine booster doses. In this self-controlled case series study, we used a database of members of the largest health-care organisation in Israel. We analysed the medical records of individuals at risk of COVID-19 complications who had received two doses of the monovalent BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine (tozinameran, Pfizer-BioNTech) as their primary course of vaccination and then also received BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine boosters between July 30, 2021, and Nov 28, 2022, as a monovalent first or second booster, or as a bivalent first, second, or third booster, or a combination of these. We included individuals who had active membership of the health-care organisation and who were alive (excluding COVID-19 deaths) throughout the entire study period. We excluded individuals who, during the study period, were either not active Clalit Health Services members or died of non-COVID-19 causes, and those who were infected with COVID-19 during the 7-day period after vaccination. Individuals' at-risk status was assessed on the day before the baseline period started. The primary outcome was non-COVID-19 hospitalisation for 29 adverse events that might be associated with vaccination. For each adverse event, we compared the risk difference of hospitalisation during a 28-day pre-vaccination baseline period versus during a 28-day post-vaccination period, using a non-parametric percentile bootstrap method. Of the 3 574 243 members of the health-care organisation, 1 073 110 received a first monovalent booster, 394 251 received a second monovalent booster, and 123 084 received a bivalent first, second, or third booster. Overall, we found no indication of an elevated risk of non-COVID-19 hospitalisation following administration of any of the booster vaccines (risk difference in events per 100 000 individuals: first monovalent booster -37·1 [95% CI -49·8 to -24·2]; second monovalent booster -37·8 [-62·2 to -13·2]; and bivalent booster -18·7 [-53·6 to 15·4]). Except for extremely rare elevated risks after the first monovalent booster-of myocarditis (risk difference 0·7 events per 100 000 individuals [95% CI 0·3-1·3]), seizures (2·2 [0·4-4·1]), and thrombocytopenia (2·6 [0·7-4·7])-we found no safety signals in other adverse events, including ischaemic stroke. This study provides the necessary vaccine safety assurances for at-risk populations to receive timed roll-out booster vaccinations. These assurances could reduce vaccine hesitancy and increase the number of at-risk individuals who opt to become vaccinated, and thereby prevent the severe outcomes associated with COVID-19.

We aimed to identify correlates of protection of BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) vaccination against COVID-19. In this prospective cohort study, households within a radius of 40 km of the Sheba Medical Center in Israel in which a new SARS-CoV-2 infection (defined as the index case) was detected within the previous 24 h were approached between July 25 and Nov 15, 2021. We included adults (aged >18 years) who had received one or two vaccine doses, had an initial negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR and no previous infection reported, and had a valid IgG and neutralising antibody result. The exposure of interest was baseline immune status, including IgG antibody concentration, neutralising antibody titre, and T-cell activation. The outcomes of interest were PCR-positive SARS-CoV-2 infection between day 2 and day 21 of follow-up and intensity of disease symptoms (self-reported via a telephone questionnaire) among participants who had a confirmed infection. Multivariable logistic and ordered logit ordinal regressions were used for the adjusted analysis. To identify immunological thresholds for clinical protection, we estimated the conditional probability of infection and moderate or severe disease for individuals with pre-exposure IgG and neutralising antibody concentrations above each value observed in the study data. From 16 675 detected index cases in the study region, 5718 household members agreed to participate, 1461 of whom were eligible to be included in our study. 333 (22·8%) of 1461 household members who were not infected with SARS-CoV-2 at baseline were infected within 21 days of follow-up. The baseline (pre-exposure) IgG and neutralising antibodies were higher in participants who remained uninfected than in those who became infected (geometric mean IgG antibody concentration 168·2 binding antibody units [BAU] per mL [95% CI 158·3-178·7] vs 130·5 BAU/mL [118·3-143·8] and geometric mean neutralising antibody titre 197·5 [181·9-214·4] vs 136 ·7 [120·3-155·4]). Increasing IgG and neutralising antibody concentrations were also significantly associated with a reduced probability of increasing disease severity. Odds of infection were significantly reduced each time baseline IgG antibody concentration increased by a factor of ten (odds ratio [OR] 0·43 [95% CI 0·26-0·70]) and each time baseline neutralising antibody titre increased by a factor of two (0·82 [0·74-0·92]). In our cohort, the probability of infection if IgG antibody concentrations were higher than 500 BAU/mL was 11% and the probability of moderate disease severity was 1%; the probability of infection if neutralising antibody titres were above or equal to 1024 was 8% and the probability of moderate disease severity was 2%. T-cell activation rates were not significantly associated with reduced probability of infection (OR 1·04, 95% CI 0·83-1·30). Both IgG and neutralising antibodies are correlates of protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our data suggest that IgG concentrations higher than 500 BAU/mL and neutralising antibody titres of 1024 or more are thresholds for immunological protection from SARS-CoV-2 delta variant infection. Potentially, updated protective thresholds against emerging variants of concern could be calculated, which could support decision makers on administration of new vaccination strategies and on the optimal period between vaccine doses.

Data are needed regarding the effect of the booster dose on the rate of confirmed coronavirus 2019 disease (Covid-19) and the rate of severe illness.

Methods: We extracted data for the period from July 30 through August 31, 2021, from the Israeli Ministry of Health database regarding 1,137,804 persons who were 60 years of age or older and had been fully vaccinated (i.e., had received two doses of BNT162b2) at least 5 months earlier. In the primary analysis, we compared the rate of confirmed Covid-19 and the rate of severe illness between those who had received a booster injection at least 12 days earlier (booster group) and those who had not received a booster injection (nonbooster group). In a secondary analysis, we evaluated the rate of infection 4 to 6 days after the booster dose as compared with the rate at least 12 days after the booster. In all the analyses, we used Poisson regression after adjusting for possible confounding factors.

Results: At least 12 days after the booster dose, the rate of confirmed infection was lower in the booster group than in the nonbooster group by a factor of 11.3 (95% confidence interval [CI], 10.4 to 12.3); the rate of severe illness was lower by a factor of 19.5 (95% CI, 12.9 to 29.5). In a secondary analysis, the rate of confirmed infection at least 12 days after vaccination was lower than the rate after 4 to 6 days by a factor of 5.4 (95% CI, 4.8 to 6.1).

Conclusions: In this study involving participants who were 60 years of age or older and had received two doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine at least 5 months earlier, we found that the rates of confirmed Covid-19 and severe illness were substantially lower among those who received a booster (third) dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine.",pubmed

It remains unclear whether these patients can return to a healthy individual three months after discharge and whether there are related sequelae.

Methods: We followed up 95 severe/critical patients and 51 mild/moderate ones who recovered from COVID-19 and were discharged from hospital for 3 months. For comparison, 28 asymptomatic COVID-19 recovered individuals and 42 uninfected healthy donors (HDs) were included. At the visit, patients were interviewed and subjected to quality-of-life evaluation (St. George respiratory questionnaire [SGRQ]), pulmonary function tests, chest CT imaging, laboratory examination, detection of immune cells, and cytokine profiling.

Findings: At three months, all recovered patients tested negative for nucleic acid of SARS-CoV-2, and most were positive for serum SARS-COV-2 IgG, but few were still positive for serum IgM. The SGRQ scores for the quality-of-life were higher in recovered patients, especially those who had had severe/critical disease. Laboratory test revealed that CRP, LDH and D-dimer, three prevalent risk factors for COVID-19 prognosis in the acute phase, did not recover to the level of uninfected HDs in the convalescence. Immune cells virtually returned to normal levels in patients who recovered from COVID-19, but some pro-inflammatory cytokines, especially chemokines and factors related to vascular injury and angiogenesis, did not return to the level of HDs, and this was especially true of severe/critical recovered patients. CT of the lungs showed that ground-glass opacity (GGO) still lingered as the main manifestation, followed by strip-like fibrosis. Artificial intelligence (AI) analysis indicated that the lesions were most prominent in the lower lobe of right lung, and were mainly found in recovered severe/critical individuals. Abnormal lung function was mainly manifested as restrictive ventilation dysfunction and lowered diffusion capacity, which was more pronounced in severe/critical COVID-19 recovered patients. Overall, the recovery status of the patients varied with the severity of the disease.

Interpretation: Decreased physical quality of life, respiratory sequelae (restrictive ventilatory dysfunction, diffusion capacity disorder, and chest CT abnormalities), vascular injury and aberrant cytokine profiles still existed three months after discharge, and were more frequent and conspicuous in severe/critical COVID-19 rehabilitation patients compared to their mild/moderate and asymptomatic counterparts.

The disease has now become a global pandemic. The purpose of this study was to explore the relationship between COVID-19 and gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms.

Methods: We collected and analyzed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 by high-throughput sequencing or reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. We reviewed electronic medical records of 405 hospitalized COVID-19 patients in the Third Hospital of Wuhan.

Results: Among the 405 confirmed patients, 210 had no GI symptoms, 195 had GI symptoms, and the first symptom of 155 patients was GI. The prevalence of vascular and digestive diseases in the group with GI symptoms was significantly higher than in the group without GI symptoms. In patients with GI symptoms, the proportion with fever, cough, dysphoria, chest tightness, poor appetite, chest pain, and pharyngeal pain was significantly higher than in those without GI symptoms.

A few longitudinal studies have reported on the persistent health effects of COVID-19, but the follow-up was limited to 1 year after acute infection. The aim of our study was to characterise the longitudinal evolution of health outcomes in hospital survivors with different initial disease severity throughout 2 years after acute COVID-19 infection and to determine their recovery status.

Methods: We did an ambidirectional, longitudinal cohort study of individuals who had survived hospitalisation with COVID-19 and who had been discharged from Jin Yin-tan Hospital (Wuhan, China) between Jan 7 and May 29, 2020. We measured health outcomes 6 months (June 16-Sept 3, 2020), 12 months (Dec 16, 2020-Feb 7, 2021), and 2 years (Nov 16, 2021-Jan 10, 2022) after symptom onset with a 6-min walking distance (6MWD) test, laboratory tests, and a series of questionnaires on symptoms, mental health, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), return to work, and health-care use after discharge. A subset of COVID-19 survivors received pulmonary function tests and chest imaging at each visit. Age-matched, sex-matched, and comorbidities-matched participants without COVID-19 infection (controls) were introduced to determine the recovery status of COVID-19 survivors at 2 years. The primary outcomes included symptoms, modified British Medical Research Council (mMRC) dyspnoea scale, HRQoL, 6MWD, and return to work, and were assessed in all COVID-19 survivors who attended all three follow-up visits. Symptoms, mMRC dyspnoea scale, and HRQoL were also assessed in controls.

Findings: 2469 patients with COVID-19 were discharged from Jin Yin-tan Hospital between Jan 7 and May 29, 2020. 1192 COVID-19 survivors completed assessments at the three follow-up visits and were included in the final analysis, 1119 (94%) of whom attended the face-to-face interview 2 years after infection. The median age at discharge was 57·0 years (48·0-65·0) and 551 (46%) were women. The median follow-up time after symptom onset was 185·0 days (IQR 175·0-197·0) for the visit at 6 months, 349·0 days (337·0-360·0) for the visit at 12 months, and 685·0 days (675·0-698·0) for the visit at 2 years. The proportion of COVID-19 survivors with at least one sequelae symptom decreased significantly from 777 (68%) of 1149 at 6 months to 650 (55%) of 1190 at 2 years (p<0·0001), with fatigue or muscle weakness always being the most frequent. The proportion of COVID-19 survivors with an mMRC score of at least 1 was 168 (14%) of 1191 at 2 years, significantly lower than the 288 (26%) of 1104 at 6 months (p<0·0001). HRQoL continued to improve in almost all domains, especially in terms of anxiety or depression: the proportion of individuals with symptoms of anxiety or depression decreased from 256 (23%) of 1105 at 6 months to 143 (12%) 1191 at 2 years (p<0·0001). The proportion of individuals with a 6MWD less than the lower limit of the normal range declined continuously in COVID-19 survivors overall and in the three subgroups of varying initial disease severity. 438 (89%) of 494 COVID-19 survivors had returned to their original work at 2 years. Survivors with long COVID symptoms at 2 years had lower HRQoL, worse exercise capacity, more mental health abnormality, and increased health-care use after discharge than survivors without long COVID symptoms. COVID-19 survivors still had more prevalent symptoms and more problems in pain or discomfort, as well as anxiety or depression, at 2 years than did controls. Additionally, a significantly higher proportion of survivors who had received higher-level respiratory support during hospitalisation had lung diffusion impairment (43 [65%] of 66 vs 24 [36%] of 66, p=0·0009), reduced residual volume (41 [62%] vs 13 [20%], p<0·0001), and total lung capacity (26 [39%] vs four [6%], p<0·0001) than did controls.

Interpretation: Regardless of initial disease severity, COVID-19 survivors had longitudinal improvements in physical and mental health, with most returning to their original work within 2 years; however, the burden of symptomatic sequelae remained fairly high. COVID-19 survivors had a remarkably lower health status than the general population at 2 years. The study findings indicate that there is an urgent need to explore the pathogenesis of long COVID and develop effective interventions to reduce the risk of long COVID.",pubmed

There were few reports illustrated the expression of Angiotensin II (AngII) in COVID-19. This study aimed to demonstrate the expression of AngII in COVID-19 and how it correlated to the disease.

Methods and Results: We enrolled 55 patients with COVID-19 admitted to Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from January 21st to February 21st, 2020. Demographic data were collected upon admission. COVID-19 nuclear acid, plasma AngII, Renin and aldosterone in the lying position without sodium restriction, and other laboratory indicators were together measured by the laboratory department of our hospital. Of the 55 patients with COVID-19, 34(61.8%) had an increased level of AngII. The severity of COVID-19 and male is positively related with the level of AngII. The level of blood lymphocyte, PCT, ALT, and AST were remarkably severe with those of normal level of AngII (P < 0.05). CD4/CD8 cells ratio was significantly higher than those of normal level of AngII (P < 0.05). The results of binary logistic regression analysis showed that the severity of COVID-19 (OR=4.123) and CD4/CD8 ratio(OR=4.050) were the co-directional impact factor while female(OR=0.146) was inverse impact factor of elevated AngII level.

Conclusion: High rate of increased level of AngII and its gender differences were detected in COVID-19 patients. Elevated AngII level were correlated with the severity of COVID-19 and CD4/CD8 ratio.",crossref

It has been suggested that SARS-CoV-2 is able to enter erythrocytes, interact with heme and porphyrin, which could influence HbA1c levels. Assessment of HbA1c levels in individuals with acute COVID-19 and after recovery may show clinical relevance of this hypothesis.

Aim: To assess HbA1c levels in patients with COVID-19 in the acute phase and in early (6-8 weeks) and late (52±2 weeks) periods after recovery.

Materials and methods: We conducted a multicenter prospective study, which included patients hospitalized in Endocrinology Research Centre and the City Clinical Hospital № 52"" diagnosed with COVID-19, virus identified/ not identified. Patients were divided into three groups according to baseline HbA1c level and the presence or absence of previous history of diabetes previous history of diabetes mellitus (DM): HbA1c ≤ 6.0%, HbA1c &gt; 6.0% and patients with DM. Patients were examined during the acute COVID-19 phase and in early (6-8 weeks) and late (52±2 weeks) periods after recovery. Oral glucose tolerance test was performed in the group with initial HbA1c &gt; 6.0% to clarify the diagnosis.

Results: We included 194 patients in the study. During the follow-up, 52 patients were examined in 6-8 week period: 7 with HbA1c ≤ 6.0%, 34 with HbA1c &gt; 6.0%, 11-with previously diagnosed DM. Carbohydrate metabolism assessment in the later stages (52±2 weeks) after recovery was performed in 78 patients: 33 patients with HbA1c ≤ 6.0%, 36 patients with HbA1c &gt; 6.0% and 9 patients with previously established diabetes. HbA1c median in patients with HbA1c ≤ 6.0% was 5.7% [5.3;5.8], with HbA1c&gt;6.0% -6.4% [6.2; 6.6], with previously diagnosed DM-7.7% [7.2; 8.9]. Statistically significant decrease in HbA1c over time 6-8 weeks after extracts were obtained in both groups of individuals without a history of DM (Wilcoxon test, p&lt;0.05). After 52±2 weeks we observed HbA1c decrease in all three groups (Fridman test, p&lt;0.05): in patients with HbA1c ≤ 6.0% median HbA1c was 5.5[5.3;5.7], with HbA1c&gt;6.0% - 6.1[6.15;6.54], with previously diagnosed DM-7.8 [5.83; 8.08]. Development of DM after 52±2 weeks was recorded in 7.24% of all examined patients without a history of DM, which is 16.6% of the total number of patients examined in dynamics with HbA1c &gt; 6.0%.

Conclusion: HbA1c elevation during the acute phase of COVID-19 may be false due to the effect of SARS-CoV-2 on hemoglobin kinetics and/or detection on the surface of the SARS-CoV-2 virion highly glycosylated S-proteins by high performance liquid chromatography determinations. Upon detection HbA1c &gt; 6.0% in patients with COVID-19 in the active phase of the disease without concomitant hyperglycemia re-determine the level of HbA1c after recovery is recommended.",crossref

We aimed to investigate the 3-year health outcomes of COVID-19 survivors and the effect of omicron re-infection. In this single-centre, longitudinal cohort study, we recruited participants with confirmed COVID-19 who were discharged from the Jin Yin-tan hospital in Wuhan, China, between Jan 7 and May 29, 2020. Participants completed three follow-up visits at 6 months (June 16 to Sept 13, 2020), 1 year (Dec 16, 2020, to Feb 7, 2021), and 2 years (Nov 16, 2021, to Jan 10, 2022) since symptom onset (reported previously). At 1-year follow-up, community controls without a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection were recruited from two communities in Wuhan and at 2 years were matched (1:1) with survivors of COVID-19 who underwent pulmonary function tests. We did a 3-year follow-up from Feb 23, 2023, to April 20, 2023, after the omicron (B.1.1.529) wave in winter, 2022. All eligible survivors of COVID-19 and community controls matched at 2-year follow-up were invited to the outpatient clinic at the hospital to complete several face-to-face questionnaires, a 6-min walking test (6MWT), and laboratory tests. A subgroup of survivors of COVID-19 identified by stratified sampling on the basis of disease severity scale score during hospitalisation and community controls underwent pulmonary function tests. Survivors of COVID-19 who received high-resolution CT and showed abnormal lung images at 2-year follow-up were invited for another assessment. We identified participants with and without long COVID at 2 years. The primary outcomes were sequelae symptoms, omicron infection, lung function, and chest imaging at the 3-year follow-up. Of 1359 COVID-19 survivors who completed 2-year and 3-year follow-up, 728 (54%) had at least one sequelae symptom at 3 years after symptom onset and before omicron infection, mainly mild to moderate severity. During the omicron wave, participants with long COVID at 2 years had a significantly higher proportion of re-infection (573 [76%] of 753 vs 409 [67%] of 606 without long COVID; p=0·0004), pneumonia (27 [5%] of 568 vs seven [2%] of 403; p=0·012). 3 months after omicron infection, 126 (62%) of 204 survivors with long COVID at 2 years had newly occurring or worse symptoms, which was significantly higher than the proportion in the non-long COVID group (85 [41%] of 205; p<0·0001) and community controls (81 [40%] of 205; p<0·0001), and not significantly different between COVID-19 survivors without long COVID and matched community controls (85 [41%] of 205 vs 81 [39%] of 206; p=0·66). Re-infection was a risk factor for dyspnoea (odds ratio 1·36 [95% CI 1·04 to 1·77]; p=0·023), anxiety or depression (OR 1·65 [1·24 to 2·20]; p=0·0007), EuroQol visual analogue scale score (β -4·51 [-6·08 to -2·95]; p<0·0001), but not for reduced daily activity (0·72 [0·38 to 1·37]; p=0·32) at 3 years. Lung function of survivors at 3 years was similar to that of matched community controls. We found irregular line, traction bronchiectasis, subpleural lines and ground glass opacity at 3 years, but the volume ratio of lung lesion to total lung was only 0·2-0·3%. Most long COVID symptoms at 3 years were mild to moderate, with lung function recovering to levels of matched controls. Survivors with long COVID had a higher proportion of participants with re-infection and newly occurring or worse symptoms 3 months after omicron infection than those without long COVID. Re-infection had increased symptom occurrence but not increased reduced daily activity. Although the organ function of survivors of COVID-19 recovered over time, those with severe long COVID symptoms, abnormal organ function, or limited mobility require urgent attention in future clinical practice and research.

The reason behind the importance of vaccination is that HCWs are at high risk to be infected with influenza virus. Among the studies addressing the rates of influenza vaccine status among HCWs, a study was conducted in three Middle East countries where the vaccination rates were 24.7%, 67.2%, and 46.4% in United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, and Oman, respectively. Now, after the pandemic of COVID-19 there are beliefs that vaccination with influenza virus could decrease the deaths from COVID-19. A recent retrospective cohort study to detect the effect of seasonal influenza vaccine on the deaths among COVID-19 patients showed that the individuals who didn’t take the influenza vaccine in the last year before being infected with COVID-19 had a higher risk of being hospitalized when compared with patients who took the vaccine. In conclusion, seasonal influenza vaccine could have an important role in the prevention of COVID-19. Seasonal influenza vaccine coverage should be improved among HCWs. New tailored health education programs to improve the attitudes and beliefs of HCWs towards seasonal influenza vaccine during the era of COVID-19 are strongly and urgently needed.",crossref

Design and participants Lungs tissues of 38 cases who died for COVID-19 in two hospital of Northern Italy were systematically analysed. Hematoxylin-eosin staining, immunohistochemistry for the inflammatory infiltrate and cellular components, electron microscopy were performed.

Results The features of the exudative and proliferative phases of Diffuse Alveolar Disease (DAD) were found: capillary congestion, necrosis of pneumocytes, hyaline membrane, interstitial oedema, pneumocyte hyperplasia and reactive atypia, platelet-fibrin thrombi. The inflammatory infiltrate was composed by macrophages in alveolar lumens and lymphocytes mainly in the interstice. Electron microscopy revealed viral particles in the cytoplasm of pneumocytes.

Conclusions and relevance The predominant pattern of lung lesions in COVID-19 patients is DAD, as described for the other two coronavirus that infect humans, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.

We present herein acase of ARDS related COVID-19 in a patient on Venovenous (VV) Extracorporeal MembraneOxygenation (ECMO) who received surfactant instillation by bronchoscopy. Case Description A 27year-old African American female was admitted to the hospital with Diabetic Ketoacidosis andtested positive for COVID-19. Patient was requiring increasing oxygen demand, so she wastransferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) where she was intubated and placed on mechanicalventilation. Given her severe ARDS, patient was placed on VV-ECMO on day 14 of hospitalization.Prior clinical trials showed that the administration of exogenous pulmonary surfactant had clinicalefficacy in the treatment of premature infants with RDS due to insufficient surfactant production. Wepresent our experience with exogenous surfactant treatments in a young patient with COVID-19-related ARDS. Exogenous Surfactant Procedure Surfactant therapy was performed via flexiblebronchoscopy on day 53 post ECMO cannulation. Patient was administered a total of 15mLsurfactant, with 1mL injected into each segment. XR Chest obtained the next day showed mildimprovement in aeration of lungs. Surfactant therapy was again repeated in 27 days, however,during the second treatment, a total of 38mL surfactant was used, with 2mL injected in eachsegment. Post treatment, patient only maintained her oxygenation above 88% for 48 hours.Discussion This case report aims to highlight the off-label use of surfactant as a rescue therapy forCOVID-19 related severe ARDS. Our experience with the administration of surfactant therapy in apatient with COVID-19 complicated by refractory hypoxic respiratory failure was limited andeducational. Our patient had severe lung damage from COVID-19 and only showed mildimprovement in her oxygenation. We suspect that this is primarily due to the severity of her ARDS,delayed timing in surfactant administration, insufficient dosing of surfactant and unknown volume ofsurfactant needed to reach the alveoli. Further studies are needed to help determine the optimaltime to administer surfactant therapy, the number of treatments required based on the severity ofARDS, the appropriate dosing and volume needed to reach the alveoli and finally identify any otherforms of surfactant delivery methods to improve patients’ clinical outcome with COVID-19 relatedARDS.",crossref

Analysis of the pathological features in the lung tissues of patients who have died with COVID-19 could help us to understand the disease pathogenesis and clinical outcomes. Methods We systematically analysed lung tissue samples from 38 patients who died from COVID-19 in two hospitals in northern Italy between Feb 29 and March 24, 2020. The most representative areas identified at macroscopic examination were selected, and tissue blocks (median seven, range five to nine) were taken from each lung and fixed in 10% buffered formalin for at least 48 h. Tissues were assessed with use of haematoxylin and eosin staining, immunohistochemical staining for inflammatory infiltrate and cellular components (including staining with antibodies against CD68, CD3, CD45, CD61, TTF1, p40, and Ki-67), and electron microscopy to identify virion localisation. Findings All cases showed features of the exudative and proliferative phases of diffuse alveolar damage, which included capillary congestion (in all cases), necrosis of pneumocytes (in all cases), hyaline membranes (in 33 cases), interstitial and intra-alveolar oedema (in 37 cases), type 2 pneumocyte hyperplasia (in all cases), squamous metaplasia with atypia (in 21 cases), and platelet–fibrin thrombi (in 33 cases). The inflammatory infiltrate, observed in all cases, was largely composed of macrophages in the alveolar lumina (in 24 cases) and lymphocytes in the interstitium (in 31 cases). Electron microscopy revealed that viral particles were predominantly located in the pneumocytes. Interpretation The predominant pattern of lung lesions in patients with COVID-19 patients is diffuse alveolar damage, as described in patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronaviruses. Hyaline membrane formation and pneumocyte atypical hyperplasia are frequent. Importantly, the presence of platelet–fibrin thrombi in small arterial vessels is consistent with coagulopathy, which appears to be common in patients with COVID-19 and should be one of the main targets of therapy.",crossref

SRC_083,Chlorine demand reduction in source water by chlorine dioxide treatment," , Jianhong Ren",1998,Drexel University,10.17918/00009759,https://doi.org/10.17918/00009759,"Chlorine has been used as a disinfectant in water treatment for a long time. It is effective in inactivating pathogenic organisms and providing a residual throughout the distribution system. However, chlorination of organic substances leads to the formation of disinfection by-products which may have harmful health effects. Source waters exert a demand for chlorine which is mostly due to organic substances and ammonia. Therefore, it is desired to reduce the chlorine demand of the source water to limit the amount of chlorine which has to be applied to achieve disinfection. The study presented here considers the use of chlorine dioxide as a preoxidant to reduce the chlorine demand prior to chlorination. Schyulkill River water taken from the laboratory tap from the raw water basin at Philadelphia Water Department’s Belmont Water Treatment Plant was used. A protocol was developed to pretreat water using chlorine dioxide and measure chlorine dioxide residual as well as the free and combined chlorine residuals. Chlorine demand is the difference between the applied chlorine dose and the remaining chlorine residual after a desired contact time. In one experiment THMs, HAA, C10 2 ' and C10 3 ' were also measured. XI The study concluded that 1) A chlorine dioxide dose of 1 mg/1 in Milli-Q water imparts a chlorine demand of about 0.4 to 0.45 mg/1 after 24 hours contact time with a dose of 4 mg/1 Cl 2 ; 2) The break point occurred earlier in the ammonia solution treated by chlorine dioxide than in the pure ammonia solution; 3) The chlorine demand of source water is increased by chlorine dioxide treatment and this is an increase in the short term chlorine demand; 4) The chlorine demand of the source water decreases with increasing applied chlorine dioxide dose when the applied chlorine dioxide dose is less than the chlorine dioxide demand; 5) The chlorine demand of the source water increases when the chlorine dioxide dose is greater than the chlorine dioxide demand of the source water; 6) The decrease in the chlorine demand between 2 and 24 hours is due to the oxidization of organic matter and the overall increase of chlorine demand in source water treated with chlorine dioxide is due to the chlorine demand by inorganic species such as C10 2 and C10 2 '; 7) In water pretreated with C10 2 , the formation of HAAs, THMs and chlorate ion increase with increasing the contact time, however, the formation of chlorite ion decreases over 24 hours contact time; 8) Chlorine dioxide pretreatment can reduce the formation of THMs and HAAs, but there is no quantitative relationship between chlorine demand and DBPs concentrations; 9) Chlorine demand can be reduced about 30% by coagulation and flocculation; 10) Chlorine dioxide contact time is not a significant parameter because C10 2 oxidization can occur very rapidly and be completed within 10 minutes; and xn 11) The C10 2 demand can be a very important parameter affecting the chlorine demand of water treated with C10 2 .",crossref

As a selective oxidant, CDS exhibits biocidal efficacy without forming trihalomethanes, unlike sodium chlorite (NaClO₂)-based products like Miracle Mineral Solution (MMS).

As many of these contaminants are recalcitrant to conventional water treatment processes, advanced abatement processes need to be added. This thesis work developed new advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) by integrating the UV light emitting diodes (UV-LEDs) that are considered as the next-generation UV radiation sources with free chlorine/inorganic chloramines/chlorine dioxide. This thesis work overcame challenges in the design and operation of the UV-LED-based AOPs: understanding the unique complexity of the photochemistry and radical chemistry of UV-LED photolysis of free chlorine, inorganic chloramines, and chlorine dioxide under potable water treatment conditions. The UV photolysis of free chlorine, inorganic chloramines, and chlorine dioxide were all highly wavelength dependent. At neutral and slightly alkaline pHs, the photolysis of chlorine and the consequential radical formation increased with increasing UV wavelength from 255 to 300 nm, and the radical yields at 265, 285 and 300 nm were higher than that at 254 nm (i.e., the emission wavelength of the conventional low-pressure UV lamps). The photolysis of monochloramine and subsequent radical generation decreased with increasing UV wavelength from 255 to 300 nm, while the photolysis of dichloramine exhibited an opposite wavelength-dependence. The photolysis of chlorine dioxide and subsequent radical production increased with increasing UV wavelength from 255 to 365 nm. The wavelength-dependences on the photolysis of free chlorine, inorganic chloramines and chlorine dioxide were more strongly affected by the molar absorptivity than the apparent/innate quantum yields of these oxidants. Selected micropollutants were destructed by the UV-LED-based AOPs via several mechanistic pathways, e.g., chlorination alone, direct UV photolysis, and radical oxidation, depending on their molecular structures. The micropollutants were partially mineralized and transformed to undesired (by)products in the UV-LED-based AOPs, and the remaining micropollutants and (by)products could be removed by post-adsorption process. The UV-LED-based AOPs also produced higher concentrations of the halogenated by-products from natural organic matter, compared to the oxidation by the chlorine/inorganic chloramines/chlorine dioxide alone. Reactive chlorine species (e.g., Cl•) were responsible for the enhanced (by)product formation. The newly established “wavelength-pH-photodecay-radical nexus” in this thesis work provides references and implications for water engineers and participants in selecting sources of UV radiation for chlorine/inorganic chloramines/chlorine dioxide photodecay and micropollutant abatement by the UV-LED-based AOPs in different water settings. The findings also offer a new direction in designing the UV-LED-based point-of-use or point-of-entry water purifiers in treating chlorine-/inorganic chloramine-/chlorine dioxide-containing potable water.",crossref

The most common systemic symptoms were fever (n=122, 61.9%), lymphadenopathy (114, 57.9%), and myalgia (n=62, 31.5%). 102/166 (61.5%) developed systemic features before the onset of mucocutaneous manifestations and 64 (38.5%) after (n=4 unknown). 27 (13.7%) presented exclusively with mucocutaneous manifestations without systemic features. 71 (36.0%) reported rectal pain, 33 (16.8%) sore throat, and 31 (15.7%) penile oedema. 27 (13.7%) had oral lesions and 9 (4.6%) had tonsillar signs. 70/195 (35.9%) participants had concomitant HIV infection. 56 (31.5%) of those screened for sexually transmitted infections had a concomitant sexually transmitted infection. Overall, 20 (10.2%) participants were admitted to hospital for the management of symptoms, most commonly rectal pain and penile swelling.

Conclusions: These findings confirm the ongoing unprecedented community transmission of monkeypox virus among gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men seen in the UK and many other non-endemic countries. A variable temporal association was observed between mucocutaneous and systemic features, suggesting a new clinical course to the disease. New clinical presentations of monkeypox infection were identified, including rectal pain and penile oedema. These presentations should be included in public health messaging to aid early diagnosis and reduce onward transmission.",pubmed

Climate warming can exacerbate the inherent pace of aging, as illustrated by a faster erosion of protective telomere DNA sequences. This biomarker integrates individual pace of life and parental effects through the germline, but whether intra- and intergenerational telomere dynamics underlies population trends remains an open question. Here, we investigated the covariation between life history, telomere length (TL), and extinction risk among three age classes in a cold-adapted ectotherm (Zootoca vivipara) facing warming-induced extirpations in its distribution limits. TL followed the same threshold relationships with population extinction risk at birth, maturity, and adulthood, suggesting intergenerational accumulation of accelerated aging rate in declining populations. In dwindling populations, most neonates inherited already short telomeres, suggesting they were born physiologically old and unlikely to reach recruitment. At adulthood, TL further explained females' reproductive performance, switching from an index of individual quality in stable populations to a biomarker of reproductive costs in those close to extirpation. We compiled these results to propose the aging loop hypothesis and conceptualize how climate-driven telomere shortening in ectotherms may accumulate across generations and generate tipping points before local extirpation.",pubmed

Theoretical models (Granvik et al. 2012, Fedorets et al. 2017) predict the existence of a steady-state population of these so-called minimoons also in the Earth-Moon system. Only one minimoon, 2006 RH120 has been discovered until recently (Kwiatkowski et al. 2009). Minimoons have been identified as viable targets for in situ exploration of metre-sized asteroids, as test cases for initial steps of asteroid resource utilisation (Granvik et al. 2013, Jedicke et al. 2018), and as constraints for the size-frequency distribution of metre-sized NEOs (Harris &amp; D'Abramo 2015, Granvik et al. 2016, Tricarico 2017, Brown et al. 2002). So far, the observational evidence of the minimoon population has been lacking. <P />Observations: The object 2020 CD3 was discovered on February 15<SUP>th</SUP> 2020 at the Mt. Lemmon station of the Catalina Sky Survey, and was reported to be on a geocentric orbit the following night. We report the results of the astrometric and photometric observational campaign of 2020 CD3 performed by Gemini North, LDT, NOT, CFHT, CSS, and other telescopes during spring 2020. By investigating the solar radiation pressure signature on the astrometry of 2020 CD3, and broad-band photometry, we present evidence that it is the second temporary natural satellite in the Earth-Moon system. We describe its discovery circumstances, physical characterisation, rotational period, orbital evolution, and possible origin. <P />Discussion: We discuss the challenges of discovering minimoons with contemporary surveys. For the first time, we are able to compare the observational evidence of minimoons with the theoretical models. We assess the capture duration and rotation period of 2020 CD3 in context of simulation and similar objects. <P />Prospects: The discovery of 2020 CD3, and the comparison to discovery predictions with other surveys (Bolin et al. 2014), assures that the expectation of discovery of tens of minimoons with LSST is realistic (Fedorets et al. 2020). With the anticipated growth of the population of minimoons, the path for further exploration of minimoons is foreseen. <P />1: Bolin et al. (2014), Icarus 241, 280 ; 2: Brown et al.

The genome of LayV is composed of 18,402 nucleotides with a genome organization that is identical to that of other henipaviruses (Figure 1A).1 LayV is most phylogenetically related to Mojiang henipavirus, which was discovered in southern China (Figure 1B).3

Genetic and Epidemiologic Characterization of LayV.
Subsequent investigation identified 35 patients with acute LayV infection in the Shandong and Henan provinces of China, among whom 26 were infected with LayV only (no other pathogens were present). These 26 patients presented with fever (100% of the patients), fatigue (54%), cough (50%), anorexia (50%), myalgia (46%), nausea (38%), headache (35%), and vomiting (35%), accompanied by abnormalities of thrombocytopenia (35%), leukopenia (54%), and impaired liver (35%) and kidney (8%) function. A serosurvey of domestic animals detected seropositivity in goats (3 of 168 [2%]) and dogs (4 of 79 [5%]). Among 25 species of wild small animals surveyed, LayV RNA was predominantly detected in shrews (71 of 262 [27%]), a finding that suggests that the shrew may be a natural reservoir of LayV. (Additional details of the study are provided in the Supplementary Methods section in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this letter at NEJM.org.)
Although the current study does not fulfill Koch’s postulates, the following findings from the patients with acute LayV infection suggest that LayV was the cause of febrile illness: LayV was the only potential pathogen detected in 26 of the 35 patients (74%) with acute LayV infection; in paired serum samples that were obtained from 14 patients during the acute and convalescent phases of infection, the IgG titers in 86% of the convalescent-phase samples were 4 times as high as those in the acute-phase samples; viremia was associated with acute LayV infection; and the patients with pneumonia had higher viral loads than those without pneumonia (mean [±SD] log10-transformed copies per milliliter, 7.64±0.98 vs. 4.52±1.13). Although human-to-human transmission has been reported for the Nipah virus,5 we found no obvious spatial or temporal aggregation of human cases or the assigned haplotypes on the basis of three common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (Figure 1C). There was no close contact or common exposure history among the patients, which suggests that the infection in the human population may be sporadic. Contact tracing of 9 patients with 15 close-contact family members revealed no close-contact LayV transmission, but our sample size was too small to determine the status of human-to-human transmission for LayV. The potential cross-reaction with Mojiang virus should be assessed to improve serologic testing.
In our study, a newly identified henipavirus of probable animal origin was associated with febrile illness, a finding that warrants further investigation to better understand associated human illness.",pubmed

Such knowledge is currently lacking for insects, which have long been regarded as the ""little things that run the world"". Even for ubiquitous insects, such as ants, which are of tremendous ecological significance, there is currently neither a reliable estimate of their total number on Earth nor of their abundance in particular biomes or habitats. We compile data on ground-dwelling and arboreal ants to obtain an empirical estimate of global ant abundance. Our analysis is based on 489 studies, spanning all continents, major biomes, and habitats. We conservatively estimate total abundance of ground-dwelling ants at over 3 × 1015and estimate the number of all ants on Earth to be almost 20 × 1015individuals. The latter corresponds to a biomass of ∼12 megatons of dry carbon. This exceeds the combined biomass of wild birds and mammals and is equivalent to ∼20% of human biomass. Abundances of ground-dwelling ants are strongly concentrated in tropical and subtropical regions but vary substantially across habitats. The density of leaf-litter ants is highest in forests, while the numbers of actively ground-foraging ants are highest in arid regions. This study highlights the central role ants play in terrestrial ecosystems but also major ecological and geographic gaps in our current knowledge. Our results provide a crucial baseline for exploring environmental drivers of ant-abundance patterns and for tracking the responses of insects to environmental change.",pubmed

We collected over 1,000 dinosaur eggshell samples from an ∼150-m-thick stratigraphically continuous fossil-rich sequence in the Shanyang Basin of central China, which is one of the most abundant dinosaur records from a Late Cretaceous sequence. We use biostratigraphy of dinosaurs and Bemalambda, magnetostratigraphy, and cyclostratigraphy from orbital cycles to establish a geochronological framework of the dinosaur fossils with a high resolution of 100,000 y. Our results demonstrate low dinosaur biodiversity during the last 2 million y of the Cretaceous, and those data indicate a decline in dinosaur biodiversity millions of years before the Cretaceous/Paleogene boundary. The end-Cretaceous catastrophic events, such as the Deccan Traps and bolide impact, probably acted on an already vulnerable ecosystem and led to nonavian dinosaur extinction.
Abstract
Whether or not nonavian dinosaur biodiversity declined prior to the end-Cretaceous mass extinction remains controversial as the result of sampling biases in the fossil record, differences in the analytical approaches used, and the rarity of high-precision geochronological dating of dinosaur fossils. Using magnetostratigraphy, cyclostratigraphy, and biostratigraphy, we establish a high-resolution geochronological framework for the fossil-rich Late Cretaceous sedimentary sequence in the Shanyang Basin of central China. We have found only three dinosaurian eggshell taxa (Macroolithus yaotunensis, Elongatoolithus elongatus, and Stromatoolithus pinglingensis) representing two clades (Oviraptoridae and Hadrosauridae) in sediments deposited between ∼68.2 and ∼66.4 million y ago, indicating sustained low dinosaur biodiversity, and that assessment is consistent with the known skeletal remains in the Shanyang and surrounding basins of central China. Along with the dinosaur eggshell records from eastern and southern China, we find a decline in dinosaur biodiversity from the Campanian to the Maastrichtian. Our results support a long-term decline in global dinosaur biodiversity prior to 66 million y ago, which likely set the stage for the end-Cretaceous nonavian dinosaur mass extinction.",crossref

In baseline questionnaires, participants in this large, racially and ethnically diverse prospective cohort self-reported their use of hair products in the prior 12 months, including hair dyes; straighteners, relaxers, or pressing products; and permanents or body waves. We estimated adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to quantify associations between hair product use and uterine cancer using Cox proportional hazard models. All statistical tests were 2-sided. Over an average of 10.9 years of follow-up, 378 uterine cancer cases were identified.

As the primary nonaqueous components of mucus (≈0.2%-5%, wt/v), mucins are critical to this function because the dense arrangement of mucin glycans allows multivalence of binding. Following nature's example, bovine submaxillary mucins (BSMs) are assembled into ""mucus-like"" gels (5%, wt/v) by dynamic covalent crosslinking reactions. The gels exhibit transient liquefaction under high shear strain and immediate self-healing behavior. This study shows that these material properties are essential to provide lubricity. The gels efficiently reduce human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and genital herpes virus type 2 (HSV-2) infectivity for various types of cells. In contrast, simple mucin solutions, which lack the structural makeup, inhibit HIV-1 significantly less and do not inhibit HSV-2. Mechanistically, the prophylaxis of HIV-1 infection by BSM gels is found to be that the gels trap HIV-1 by binding to the envelope glycoprotein gp120 and suppress cytokine production during viral exposure. Therefore, the authors believe the gels are promising for further development as personal lubricants that can limit viral transmission.",pubmed

The population sampled at these sites was significantly biased towards males (sex ratio 1F:1.67M) and only 12.9% of individuals were resighted. We used mark-resight models to estimate demographic parameters of the population, including superpopulation size, survival probability, entry/recruitment probability, and detection probability. We also evaluated how these parameters were related to environmental predictors, such as El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), sea surface temperature (SST), and chlorophylla(chla). Mark-resight analyses indicated that SST, chla, time, and sex, but not ENSO, were important predictors of estimated population parameters. Entry probability peaked in 2012, which coincided with the lowest SST and highest chlaconcentrations. The best-fit mark-resight model estimated a superpopulation size of 22316 individuals, with annual estimated abundances of 949-7650 females and 5226-9340 males.

This rotation has been inferred from temporal changes between repeated seismic waves that should traverse the same path through the inner core. Here we analyse repeated seismic waves from the early 1990s and show that all of the paths that previously showed significant temporal changes have exhibited little change over the past decade. This globally consistent pattern suggests that differential inner-core rotation has recently paused. We compared this recent pattern to the Alaskan seismic records of South Sandwich Islands doublets going back to 1964 and it seems to be associated with a gradual turning-back of the inner core relative to the mantle as a part of an approximately seven-decade oscillation, with another turning point in the early 1970s. This multidecadal periodicity coincides with changes in several other geophysical observations, especially the length of day and magnetic field. These observations provide evidence for dynamic interactions between the Earth's layers, from the deepest interior to the surface, potentially due to gravitational coupling and the exchange of angular momentum from the core and mantle to the surface.",nasa_ads

Several planetary formation models have been proposed to explain the observed abundance and variety of compositions of super-Earths and mini-Neptunes. In this context, multitransiting systems orbiting low-mass stars whose planets are close to the radius valley are benchmark systems, which help to elucidate which formation model dominates.
Aims: We report the discovery, validation, and initial characterization of one such system, TOI-2096 (TIC 142748283), a two-planet system composed of a super-Earth and a mini-Neptune hosted by a mid-type M dwarf located 48 pc away.
Methods: We characterized the host star by combining optical spectra, analyzing its broadband spectral energy distribution, and using evolutionary models for low-mass stars. Then, we derived the planetary properties by modeling the photometric data from TESS and ground-based facilities. In addition, we used archival data, high-resolution imaging, and statistical validation to support our planetary interpretation.
Results: We found that the stellar properties of TOI-2096 correspond to a dwarf star of spectral type M4±0.5. It harbors a super-Earth (R = 1.24 ± 0.07 R⊕) and a mini-Neptune (R = 1.90 ± 0.09 R⊕) in likely slightly eccentric orbits with orbital periods of 3.12 d and 6.39 d, respectively. These orbital periods are close to the first-order 2:1 mean-motion resonance (MMR), a configuration that may lead to measurable transit timing variations (TTVs). We computed the expected TTVs amplitude for each planet and found that they might be measurable with high-precision photometry delivering mid-transit times with accuracies of ≲2 min. Moreover, we conclude that measuring the planetary masses via radial velocities (RVs) could also be possible. Lastly, we found that these planets are among the best in their class to conduct atmospheric studies using the NIRSpec/Prism onboard the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST).
Conclusions: The properties of this system make it a suitable candidate for further studies, particularly for mass determination using RVs and/or TTVs, decreasing the scarcity of systems that can be used to test planetary formation models around low-mass stars.",crossref

Here we calculate a previously unquantified contribution to subsidence from the cumulative mass and downward pressure exerted by the built environment of the city. We enforce that load distribution in a multiphysics finite element model to calculate expected subsidence. Complex surface geology requires multiple rheological soil models to be applied; clay rich soils and artificial fill are calculated to have the highest post-construction subsidence as compared with more elastic soils. Minimum and maximum calculated building subsidence ranges from 0 to 600 mm depending on soil/rock physical parameters and foundation modes. We compare modeled subsidence and surface geology to observed subsidence rates from satellite data (Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar and Global Positioning System). The comparison is complicated because the urban load has accumulated across a much longer period than measured subsidence rates, and there are multiple causes of subsidence. Geodetic measurements show a mean subsidence rate of 1–2 mm/year across the city that is consistent with regional post-glacial deformation, though we find some areas of significantly greater subsidence rates. Some of this deformation is consistent with internal consolidation of artificial fill and other soft sediment that may be exacerbated by recent building loads, though there are many possible causes. New York is emblematic of growing coastal cities all over the world that are observed to be subsiding (Wu et al., 2022, https://doi.org/10.1029/2022GL098477), meaning there is a shared global challenge of mitigation against a growing inundation hazard.

On the other hand, there are still few reports regarding the effects of taVNS on motor learning in healthy subjects. In the present study, we investigated how taVNS affects a reaching movement task under a force field condition (i.e., force field learning). A total of 32 healthy, right-handed subjects were divided into a taVNS and a sham group. Subjects were asked to make reaching movements with their right arm while holding the handle of the manipulandum against a velocity-dependent curl force field. The results demonstrated that taVNS reduced the maximum rightward displacement (i.e., error amplitude) during the force field learning, and the final values were significantly smaller in taVNS groups than in sham groups.

Recent research indicates that emotional dysregulation and persistent inflammation are closely linked and serve as key pathophysiological features of these conditions. Emotional dysregulation is mechanistically coupled to the activity of the locus coeruleus and norepinephrine (LC-NE; noradrenergic) system. Arising from chronic stress, persistently elevated activity of the noradrenergic system leads to hypervigilance, anxious states, and depressed mood. Concurrently, these disorders are marked by systemic inflammation as indicated by elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines, and central neuroinflammation indicated by microglial activation in brain regions and networks involved in mood regulation and emotional control. In turn, chronic inflammation increases sympathetic tone and LC-NE activity resulting in a vortex of psychoneuroimmunological dysfunction that worsens mental health. Transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) in a non-invasive neuromodulation method uniquely positioned to address both noradrenergic dysfunction and chronic inflammation in neuropsychiatric applications. Evidence spanning the past couple decades demonstrates taVNS works via two complementary mechanisms. An ascending pathway engages vagal afferents projecting to the LC-NE system in the brain stem, which has been shown to modulate cortical arousal, cognitive function, mood, and stress responses. Through descending circuits taVNS can modulate the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway to suppresses the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines like TNF-α and IL-6 mitigating poor health outcomes caused by inflammation. By enhancing both central brain function and peripheral immune responses, taVNS has shown significant potential for recalibrating perturbed affective-cognitive processing. The present article describes and discusses recent evidence suggesting that taVNS offers a promising network-based paradigm for restoring psychoneuroimmunological homeostasis in common neuropsychiatric conditions.</jats:p>",crossref

Theoretical models (Granvik et al. 2012, Fedorets et al. 2017) predict the existence of a steady-state population of these objects, also known as minimoons, also in the Earth-Moon system. Only one minimoon, 2006 RH120 has been discovered until recently (Kwiatkowski et al. 2009). Since minimoons spend a significant amount of time in Earth&amp;#8217;s vicinity, they have been identified as outstanding targets for in situ exploration, or test cases for initial steps of asteroid resource utilisation (Granvik et al. 2013, Chyba et al. 2014, Brelsford et al. 2016, Jedicke et al. 2018). Moreover, not only are minimoons outstanding targets to constrain the size-frequency distribution of metre-sized asteroids (Harris &amp;amp; D&amp;#8217;Abramo 2015, Granvik et al. 2016, Tricarico 2017, Brown et al. 2002), but also for studying the structure of the smallest asteroids. However, until now, the observational evidence of the minimoon population has been lacking.ObservationsThe object 2020 CD3 was discovered on February 15th 2020 at the Mt. Lemmon station of the Catalina Sky Survey, and was noticed to be on a geocentric orbit the following night. We report the results of the astrometric and photometric observational campaign to characterise 2020 CD3 performed by Gemini North, LDT, NOT, CFHT, CSS, and other telescopes during spring 2020. By investigating the solar radiation pressure signature on the astrometry of 2020 CD3, and broad-band photometry, we present evidence that 2020 CD3 is indeed the second temporary natural satellite in the Earth-Moon system. We describe its discovery circumstances, physical characterisation, rotational period and orbital evolution.DiscussionUsing 2020 CD3 as an example case, we discuss the challenges of discovering minimoons with contemporary surveys. For the first time, we are able to compare the observational evidence of minimoons with the theoretical models. We also assess the capture duration and rotation period of 2020 CD3 in context of simulation and similar objects. Finally, we compare the origin of minimoons as captured objects from the NEO population against their origin as lunar ejecta, and show why the first mechanism is dominant.ProspectsThe discovery of 2020 CD3, and the comparison to discovery predictions with other surveys (Bolin et al. 2014), assures that the expectation of discovery of tens of minimoons with LSST is realistic (Fedorets et al. 2020). With the anticipated growth of the population of minimoons, the path for further exploration of minimoons is foreseen.ReferencesBolin et al. (2014), Icarus 241, 280Brelsford et al.

In this study, the dynamical evolution of this object is conducted in a framework of Circular Restricted Three-Body Problem (CR3BP). Five thousand test objects are generated by distributing the orbital space with a random uniform scheme around the object’s nominal values comprising ten sigma-uncertainties of the orbital parameters and four Metonic cycles of the epoch. This numerical task has run for 1000 years with the IAS15 integrator known for its adaptive integration and high accuracy for millions of years of simulation. We found that almost all of the test particles are lying in a boundary region, hence follow chaotic and quasi-periodic trajectories and have become minimoon with an average of 15-16 times. The duration of captures of more than a year is very rare. Interestingly, there seems a preferred recapture time at ∼ 30 years. Most of them still stay in the ELO region, although a few have either been hit the Earth or expelled into vast space.</jats:p>",crossref

Pigs are the natural hosts of NiV and can potentially transmit this disease to humans. Establishing a rapid, sensitive, and accurate point-of-care detection method is critical in the timely identification of infected pig herds. In this study, we developed an NiV detection method based on reverse transcription-recombinase polymerase amplification (RT-RAA) and the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-associated protein 13a (Cas13a) system for the precise detection of NiV. The highly conserved region of the NiV gene was selected as the detection target. We first designed eleven pairs of RT-RAA primers, and the optimal primer combination and reaction temperature were identified on the basis of RT-RAA efficiency. Additionally, the most efficient crRNA sequence was selected on the basis of the fluorescence signal intensity. The results revealed that the optimal reaction temperature for the developed method was 37 °C. The detection limit was as low as 1.565 copies/μL. Specificity testing revealed no cross-reactivity with nucleic acids from six common swine viruses, including Seneca virus A (SVA), foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV), classical swine fever virus (CSFV), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), African swine fever virus (ASFV), and pseudorabies virus (PRV). A validation test using simulated clinical samples revealed a 100% concordance rate. The detection results can be visualized via a fluorescence reader or lateral flow strips (LFSs). Compared with conventional detection methods, this RT-RAA-CRISPR/Cas13a-based method is rapid and simple and does not require scientific instruments. Moreover, the reagents can be freeze-dried for storage, eliminating the need for cold-chain transportation.

This virus belongs to the Paramyxoviridae family and carries a non-segmented, single-stranded negative-sense RNA genome. Shrews may be the natural reservoir of the virus. Clinical symptoms range from mild flu-like symptoms to severe manifestations involving pneumonia, haematological disorders, and organ dysfunction. Diagnostic methods include PCR and ELISA assays. Despite the absence of established treatments, antiviral drugs such as ribavirin and chloroquine may be useful in some cases. In light of prevention, a comprehensive approach that emphasises multidisciplinary collaboration is crucial for early surveillance and response.

Presently, vaccination stands as a critical preventive measure for mitigating infection-related risks. Although the initial clinical trials for the COVID-19 vaccines excluded pregnant women, subsequent investigations have indicated mRNA vaccinations' effectiveness and short-term safety during pregnancy. However, there is a lack of information regarding the potential biodistribution of the vaccine mRNA during pregnancy and lactation. Recent findings indicate that COVID-19 vaccine mRNA has been detected in breast milk, suggesting that its presence is not confined to the injection site and raises the possibility of similar distribution to the placenta and the fetus. Furthermore, the potential effects and responses of the placenta and fetus to the vaccine mRNA are still unknown. While potential risks might exist with the exposure of the placenta and fetus to the COVID-19 mRNA vaccine, the application of mRNA therapies for maternal and fetal conditions offers a groundbreaking prospect. Future research should leverage the unique opportunity provided by the first-ever application of mRNA vaccines in humans to understand their biodistribution and impact on the placenta and fetus in pregnant women.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommend that lactating individuals receive COVID-19 mRNA vaccines and stay up to date on booster doses, including the bivalent COVID-19 booster. The lack of serious side effects in mothers or infants across numerous large studies and registries of COVID-19 vaccination in pregnancy and lactation is reassuring. Although small quantities of mRNA may be transiently detectable in breast milk after maternal vaccination, there are no data demonstrating that vaccine mRNA can survive the infant gastrointestinal tract and no evidence that breast milk from lactating individuals who have received a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine can cause harm to breastfeeding infants. In contrast, numerous studies demonstrate that the breast milk of vaccinated individuals contains severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-specific functional antibodies and T cells, which benefit the breastfeeding infant's developing immune system. Transfer of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies from mother to infant is highest when vaccination occurs during pregnancy compared with lactation, because the breastfeeding infant receives both long-lasting antibodies through the placenta and breast-milk antibodies through breast milk. With clear data demonstrating efficacy and safety and no data demonstrating harm to mother or infant after COVID-19 vaccine administration during lactation, any recommendations to avoid vaccination while breastfeeding or to withhold breast milk from the infant for any period of time after vaccination are not supported by available evidence.",pubmed

Macrozooplankton are an important link between higher and lower trophic levels in the oceans. They serve as the primary food for fish, reptiles, birds and mammals in some regions, and play a role in the export of carbon from the surface to the intermediate and deep ocean. Little, however, is known of their global distribution and biomass. Here we compiled a dataset of macrozooplankton abundance and biomass observations for the global ocean from a collection of four datasets. We harmonise the data to common units, calculate additional carbon biomass where possible, and bin the dataset in a global 1 × 1 degree grid. This dataset is part of a wider effort to provide a global picture of carbon biomass data for key plankton functional types, in particular to support the development of marine ecosystem models. Over 387 700 abundance data and 1330 carbon biomass data have been collected from pre-existing datasets. A further 34 938 abundance data were converted to carbon biomass data using species-specific length frequencies or using species-specific abundance to carbon biomass data. Depth-integrated values are used to calculate known epipelagic macrozooplankton biomass concentrations and global biomass. Global macrozooplankton biomass, to a depth of 350 m, has a mean of 8.4 μg C L−1, median of 0.2 μg C L−1 and a standard deviation of 63.5 μg C L−1. The global annual average estimate of macrozooplankton biomass in the top 350 m, based on the median value, is 0.02 Pg C. There are, however, limitations on the dataset; abundance observations have good coverage except in the South Pacific mid-latitudes, but biomass observation coverage is only good at high latitudes. Biomass is restricted to data that is originally given in carbon or to data that can be converted from abundance to carbon. Carbon conversions from abundance are restricted by the lack of information on the size of the organism and/or the absence of taxonomic information. Distribution patterns of global macrozooplankton biomass and statistical information about biomass concentrations may be used to validate biogeochemical and plankton functional type models.

The interspecies transmission of bat coronaviruses to other mammalian hosts, including livestock and humans, can lead to epidemics, epizootics, and global pandemics. This study aims to describe coronaviruses associated with horseshoe bats (Rhinolophusspp.) in the southern regions of the European part of Russia. Fecal samples were collected from bats inhabiting caves on the southern macroslope of the Greater Caucasus (Sochi-Adler region) during 2020, 2021, and 2024. Viral genomes were detected and analyzed using high-throughput sequencing (NGS) and RT-PCR. A novel alphacoronavirus, designated Kudep virus (GenBank acc. # PQ649435), was identified inR. ferrumequinum. Presumably the Kudep virus represents a novel species within the subgenusDecacovirusof the genusAlphacoronavirus.The virus Showed 72% nucleotide identity to a Cardioderma bat coronavirus from Kenya and up to 67% nucleotide identity to the YN2012 virus group found in horseshoe bats in China. RT-PCR screening revealed active circulation of both Kudep virus and the previously described SARS-like betacoronavirus Khosta-1 in the study area. Infection rates in a singleR. ferrumequinumcolony during autumn 2021 reached 59.2% and 70.5% for Kudep and Khosta-1, respectively. Frequent co-infections with both viruses were observed in individual bats. Our findings expand the understanding of the distribution of bat alphacoronaviruses and their genetic diversity.

The potential danger associated with these new species ofSarbecovirusis that Khosta-2 has been found to interact with the same entry receptor as SARS-CoV-2. Our multidisciplinary approach in this study demonstrates that Khosta-1 and -2 currently appear to be not dangerous with low risk of spillover, as confirmed by prevalence data and by phylogenomic reconstruction. In addition, the interaction between Khosta-1 and -2 with ACE2 appears weak, and furin cleavage sites are absent. While the possibility of a spillover event cannot be entirely excluded, it is currently highly unlikely. This research further emphasizes the importance of assessing the zoonotic potential of widely distributed batborne CoV in order to monitor changes in genomic composition of viruses and prevent spillover events (if any).",pubmed

Product use varied by race/ethnicity, nativity, and messaging from family and peers. Black respondents were more likely to ever use chemical straighteners than non-Black respondents (OR = 2.0; 95% CI = 1.2-3.2), as were respondents who heard that family members express a preference for straight hair compared with respondents whose family members expressed mixed preferences about hairstyles (OR = 2.0; 95% CI = 1.1-3.7).

Respondents' perceptions that others believe straight hair or lighter skin confer benefits such as beauty, professionalism, or youth were associated with greater use of chemical straighteners and skin lighteners. These findings highlight the pervasiveness of racialized beauty norms and point to the need to reduce the demand for and sale of these products through community education, market-based strategies, and public policy.",pubmed

Rheological investigations showed that the hydrogel exhibits interesting properties, namely, relatively low critical gel concentration, elastic response with slow dynamics, remarkable extended critical strain to flow, shear responsiveness, injectability, 3D printability and self-healing. Due to the weak nature of the involved polyelectrolyte segments, the hydrogel properties display pH-dependency, and they are affected by the presence of salt. Especially upon varying pH, the PLL secondary structure changes from random coil to α-helix, affecting the crosslinking structural mode and, in turn, the overall network structure as reflected in the rheological properties.

Here, mucin glycoproteins play a key role, and purified mucins can be used to create coatings or solutions that provide lubricity and reduce surface wear. However, for certain applications, such as medical lubricants, a hydrogel formulation may be required instead of a low‐viscosity mucin solution. Different strategies are explored to create mucin‐based gels, but it remains unclear which gel‐formation strategy is best suitable for providing suitable viscoelastic properties and, at the same time, good lubricity and wear prevention. In this study, mucin‐based gels with distinct crosslinking architectures but similar viscoelastic properties are developed and characterized in terms of their ability to reduce friction and tissue damage. Among the chemically and physically crosslinked mucin gels tested here, tannic acid is identified as the most suitable crosslinking agent; with this molecule, mucin gels are obtained with very good self‐healing properties and high lubrication and wear prevention performances on intestinal tissue. In the future, by building on these results, tailored mucin gels can be developed whose properties can be fine‐tuned to fit the specific requirements of different biomedical applications.</jats:p>",crossref

For instance, self-healing organic colloidal gels have been developed by self-assembly of oppositely charged gelatin nanoparticles, where the mechanical properties and self-healing capacity of the colloidal gels strongly depended on the size of the colloidal building blocks. Furthermore, in order to develop colloidal gels with enhanced elasticity, combinations of organic and inorganic building blocks were recently explored.

Although this species is widely distributed throughout the world's tropical and subtropical oceanic waters, like many deep-water species, it remains very poorly understood due to its mesopelagic distribution. We used a suite of biochemical tracers, including stable isotope analysis (SIA), fatty acid analysis (FAA), and environmental DNA (eDNA), to investigate the trophic ecology of this species in the Central Pacific around Hawaii. We found that large epipelagic prey constituted a relatively minor part of the overall diet. Surprisingly, small micronektonic and forage species (meso- and epipelagic) are the most important prey group for Cookiecutter sharks across the studied size range (17-43 cm total length), with larger mesopelagic species or species that exhibit diel vertical migration also being important prey. These results were consistent across all the tracer techniques employed. Our results indicate that Cookiecutter sharks play a unique role in pelagic food webs, feeding on prey ranging from the largest apex predators to small, low trophic level species, in particular those that overlap with the depth distribution of the sharks throughout the diel cycle. We also found evidence of a potential shift in diet and/or habitat with size and season. Environmental DNA metabarcoding revealed new prey items for Cookiecutter sharks while also demonstrating that eDNA can be used to identify recent prey in stomachs frozen for extended periods. Integrating across chemical tracers is a powerful tool for investigating the ecology of elusive and difficult to study species, such as meso- and bathypelagic chondrichthyans, and can increase the amount of information gained from small sample sizes. Better resolving the foraging ecology of these mesopelagic predators is critical for effective conservation and management of these taxa and ecosystems, which are intrinsically vulnerable to overfishing and exploitation.",pubmed

The analysis is part of the Vienna Transdanube Aging Study, a prospective, community-based cohort study of all 75-year-old inhabitants of 2 Viennese districts. Current depressive symptoms were captured with a DSM-IV-TR-based questionnaire. Diagnosis of possible or probable Alzheimer's dementia was performed according to criteria by the National Institute of Neurologic and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association. The baseline sample included 437 not-demented and not previously depressed individuals. At 60-month follow-up, 65 of the remaining 296 subjects had possible or probable Alzheimer's dementia. The primary outcome measure was the probability of diagnosis of Alzheimer's dementia related to baseline depressive symptoms. Baseline data were collected between May 2000 and December 2002; 60-month follow-up data were collected between June 2005 and February 2008. 10.8% of those who were diagnosed with possible or probable Alzheimer's dementia at 60-month follow-up had shown loss of interest versus 2.2% in the nondemented group. The analysis showed a significant association of loss of interest only with the later occurrence of possible or probable Alzheimer's dementia (adjusted P value <.05, OR = 5.27 [95% CI, 1.62-17.2], area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.541). The specificity of this symptom in predicting Alzheimer's dementia was 97.8, and the sensitivity was 10.4. Of 9 symptoms of depression, only loss of interest was associated with the development of Alzheimer's dementia over a period of 5 years in a sample of 75-year-old not-demented, never-depressed subjects, suggesting that depressive symptoms in the elderly are mostly symptoms of genuine depression.",pubmed

This immunohistochemical study determined the extent of AD-related changes in temporal cortex resected from individuals treated surgically for severe TBI. Antisera generated against Abeta species (total Abeta, Abeta(1-42), and Abeta(1-40)), the C-terminal of the Abeta precursor protein (APP), apolipoprotein E (apoE), and markers of neuron structure and degeneration (tau, ubiquitin, alpha-, beta-, and gamma-synuclein) were used to examine the extent of Abeta plaque deposition and neurodegenerative changes in 18 TBI subjects (ages 18-64 years). Diffuse cortical Abeta deposits were observed in one third of subjects (aged 35-62 years) as early as 2 h after injury, with only one (35-year old) individual exhibiting ""mature"", dense-cored plaques. Plaque-like deposits, neurons, glia, and axonal changes were also immunostained with APP and apoE antibodies. In plaque-positive cases, the only statistically significant change in cellular immunostaining was increased neuronal APP (P = 0.013). There was no significant correlation between the distribution of Abeta plaques and markers of neuronal degeneration. Diffuse tau immunostaining was localized to neuronal cell soma, axons or glial cells in a larger subset of individuals. Tau-positive, neurofibrillary tangle (NFT)-like changes were detected in only two subjects, both of more advanced age and who were without Abeta deposits. Other neurodegenerative changes, evidenced by ubiquitin- and synuclein-immunoreactive neurons, were abundant in the majority of cases. Our results demonstrate a differential distribution and course of intra- and extra-cellular AD-like changes during the acute phase following severe TBI in humans. Abeta plaques and early evidence of neuronal degenerative changes can develop rapidly after TBI, while fully developed NFTs most likely result from more chronic disease- or injury-related processes. These observations lend further support to the hypothesis that head trauma significantly increases the risk of developing pathological and clinical symptoms of AD, and provide insight into the molecular mechanisms that initiate these pathological cascades very early during severe brain injury.",pubmed

        <p>Unraveling the problem of impossibly early galaxies, we propose a model in which a galaxy’s luminosity consistently depends on two types of stars that differ only in mass and thus have different types of their evolution. At the initial stage, up to 1 Gyr from the Big Bang, the luminosity is mostly determined by stars with masses greater than 8М<sub>🖸</sub>, which have a short life cycle and inevitably end their evolution with supernovae outbursts. But then, in the later Universe, the galaxy luminosity function (GLF) begins to depend on the much more numerous stars with masses less than 8М<sub>🖸</sub>, which continue on the main sequence. Thus, we find that the initial increased luminosity (“supernovae fireworks”) occurs at much lower galaxy masses. To evaluate the hypothesis, we propose an observational test, where we measure the luminosity irregularities (&gt; 3σ) of those six too bright early galaxies, to be taken over a period of 8–12 months.</p>",crossref

A major uncertainty in the interpretation is whether the red colors are caused by evolved stellar populations, dust, or other effects such as emission lines or active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Here we show that three of the massive galaxy candidates at z = 6.7–8.4 have prominent Balmer breaks in JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy from the RUBIES program. The Balmer breaks demonstrate unambiguously that stellar emission dominates at λ <SUB>rest</SUB> = 0.4 μm and require formation histories extending hundreds of millions of years into the past in galaxies only 600–800 Myr after the big bang. Two of the three galaxies also show broad Balmer lines, with Hβ FWHM &gt; 2500 km s<SUP>‑1</SUP>, suggesting that dust-reddened AGNs contribute to, or even dominate, the spectral energy distributions of these galaxies at λ <SUB>rest</SUB> ≳ 0.6 μm. All three galaxies have relatively narrow [O III] lines, seemingly ruling out a high-mass interpretation if the lines arise in dynamically relaxed, inclined disks. Yet the inferred masses also remain highly uncertain. We model the high-quality spectra using Prospector to decompose the continuum into stellar and AGN components and explore limiting cases in stellar/AGN contribution. This produces a wide range of possible stellar masses, spanning M <SUB>⋆</SUB> ∼ 10<SUP>9</SUP>‑10<SUP>11</SUP> M <SUB>⊙</SUB>. Nevertheless, all fits suggest a very early and rapid formation, most of which follow with a truncation in star formation. Potential origins and evolutionary tracks for these objects are discussed, from the cores of massive galaxies to low-mass galaxies with overmassive black holes. Intriguingly, we find all of these explanations to be incomplete; deeper and redder data are needed to understand the physics of these systems.",nasa_ads

For their apparent stellar masses, the galaxies are smaller than any other galaxy population that has been observed at any other redshift. We use the fits to derive circularized three-dimensional stellar mass profiles of the galaxies, and compare these to the mass profiles of massive quiescent galaxies at z ~ 2.3 and nearby elliptical galaxies. Despite the fact that the high-redshift galaxies have 10-20 times smaller half-light radii than their putative descendants, the central stellar densities are very similar. The most straightforward interpretation is that the dense compact inner regions of the most massive ellipticals today were already in place ~600 Myr after the Big Bang. We caution that the redshifts and masses of the galaxies remain to be confirmed, and that the complex NIRCam point-spread function is not yet fully characterized.",nasa_ads

The rotation has been inferred from temporal changes of repeating seismic waves traversing the inner core. In our recent study1, we report remarkable observations that all the paths previously with significant temporal changes have now exhibited little changes over the recent decade. The consistent global pattern suggests strongly that the inner core rotates as a whole and the rotation has paused in the recent decade with a net torque of ~1016 Nm. Furthermore, the recent pattern seems associated with a gradual turning-back as a part of a long-period (about seven decades) oscillation with another turning point in the early 1970s. The multidecadal periodicity coincides with changes in several other geophysical observations, including the global mean temperature2, the global mean sea level rise3, and especially the length of day (LOD) and magnetic field variations4, pointing to a common resonating system of the Earth.

The size of our star sample and the precision achieved with HARPS have allowed the detection of a sufficiently large number of low-mass planets to study the statistical properties of their orbital elements, the correlation of the host-star metallicity with the planet masses, as well as the occurrence rate of planetary systems around solar-type stars. A robust estimate of the frequency of systems shows that more than 50% of solar-type stars harbor at least one planet of any mass and with period up to 100 days. Different properties are observed for the population of planets less massive than about 30M-Earth compared to the population of gaseous giant planets. The mass distribution of Super-Earths and Neptune-mass planets (SEN) is strongly increasing between 30 and 15M-Earth. The SEN occurence rate does not exhibit a preference for metal rich stars. Most of the SEN planets belong to multi-planetary systems. The orbital eccentricities of the SEN planets seems limited to 0.45. At the opposite, the occurence rate of gaseous giant planets is growing with the logarithm of the period, and is strongly increasing with the host-star metallicity. About 14% of solar-type stars have a planetary companion more massive than 50M-Earth? on an orbit with a period shorter than 10 years. Orbital eccentricities of giant planets are observed up to 0.9 and beyond. The precision of HARPS-type spectrographs opens the possibility to detect planets in the habitable zone of solar-type stars. Identification of a significant number of super-Earths orbiting solar-type of the Sun vicinity is achieved by Doppler spectroscopy. 37 newly discovered planets are announced in the Appendix of this paper, among which 15 Super-Earths.",nasa_ads

The mass-loss rates are based on hydrodynamic models of evaporation that include both X-ray and EUV irradiation. We find that only low mass planets with hydrogen envelopes are significantly affected by evaporation, with evaporation being able to remove massive hydrogen envelopes inward of ~0.1 AU for Neptune-mass objects, while evaporation is negligible for Jupiter-mass objects. Moreover, most of the evaporation occurs in the first 100 Myr of stars' lives when they are more chromospherically active. We construct a theoretical population of planets with varying core masses, envelope masses, orbital separations, and stellar spectral types, and compare this population with the sizes and densities measured for low-mass planets, both in the Kepler mission and from radial velocity surveys. This exercise leads us to conclude that evaporation is the driving force of evolution for close-in Kepler planets. In fact, some 50% of the Kepler planet candidates may have been significantly eroded. Evaporation explains two striking correlations observed in these objects: a lack of large radius/low density planets close to the stars and a possible bimodal distribution in planet sizes with a deficit of planets around 2 R <SUB>⊕</SUB>. Planets that have experienced high X-ray exposures are generally smaller than this size, and those with lower X-ray exposures are typically larger. A bimodal planet size distribution is naturally predicted by the evaporation model, where, depending on their X-ray exposure, close-in planets can either hold on to hydrogen envelopes ~0.5%-1% in mass or be stripped entirely. To quantitatively reproduce the observed features, we argue that not only do low-mass Kepler planets need to be made of rocky cores surrounded with hydrogen envelopes, but few of them should have initial masses above 20 M <SUB>⊕</SUB> and the majority of them should have core masses of a few Earth masses.",nasa_ads

(We refer to a comet with perihelion distance &lt;2.5 AU as a ""visible"" comet.) Of those, 99.7% were Jupiter-family comets (as defined by their Tisserand parameter, hereafter ""JFCs"") when they first became visible, although some evolved out of the Jupiter family as time progressed. By comparing the observed orbital element distribution of JFCs to that produced by our simulations we deduce that JFCs are statistically most likely to have physical lifetimes of ∼12,000 years.

This conclusion assumes that the rate of objects leaving the Kuiper belt has remained approximately constant over the history of the Solar System. We calculate the orbital distribution of this population and show that ∼90% are beyond the orbit of Neptune at any given time. In addition, we calculate the impact rates of these objects onto the planets. We find that a JFC impact onto Jupiter happens approximately once every 400 years and one on the Earth should occur once every 13 million years.",nasa_ads

In this paper, we identify dust substructures in 12 disks and measure their properties to investigate how they form. This subsample of disks is selected from a high-resolution (∼0.″12) ALMA 1.33 mm survey of 32 disks in the Taurus star-forming region, which was designed to cover a wide range of brightness and to be unbiased to previously known substructures. While axisymmetric rings and gaps are common within our sample, spiral patterns and high-contrast azimuthal asymmetries are not detected. Fits of disk models to the visibilities lead to estimates of the location and shape of gaps and rings, the flux in each disk component, and the size of the disk. The dust substructures occur across a wide range of stellar mass and disk brightness. Disks with multiple rings tend to be more massive and more extended. The correlation between gap locations and widths, the intensity contrast between rings and gaps, and the separations of rings and gaps could all be explained if most gaps are opened by low-mass planets (super-Earths and Neptunes) in the condition of low disk turbulence (α = 10<SUP>-4</SUP>).

The same theory also predicts that contrary to what has been predicted on the basis of the logical deduction that the monkeypox virus detected in this outbreak is of a less virulent clade, such severe outcomes of the co-manifestation of these diseases will cause death in those in whom such spectral diseases co-manifest if we do not understand, early enough, such immunological conditions in a manner that enables us to prevent their disappearance and bring about their reappearance. And it predicts that such severe outcomes of the co-manifestation of these spectral diseases will appear catastrophically and decimate populations all over the world if the disappearance of such conditions becomes sufficiently widespread before this most important understanding is achieved. All organizations that are concerned with the noble task of protecting humankind from diseases are urged to do all they can for the completion, in the shortest possible time, of the illustration of reality required to achieve such understanding.</p>",crossref

Seventeen boys with congenital RUF who underwent one-stage laparoscopy-assisted anorectoplasty (LAARP) between July 2012 and June 2015 were retrospectively in the study. All patients successfully underwent one-staged laparoscopic surgery without conversion. The recto-prostatic urethral fistula was encountered in 6 patients and recto-urethral bulbar fistula in 11 patients. The mean age at the time of surgery was 46.2 hours with mean length of hospital stay being 10.6 days. The operative times for the recto-urethral prostatic fistula and recto-urethral bulbar fistula were similar (128.2 versus 122.4 minutes, P = .091). Intraoperative blood loss was minimal. No injury to the urethra or vas deferens. The urethral catheter was removed on postoperative day 10. No one lost to follow-up. The median follow-up period was 2.6 years (range: 2-4 years). No recurrent fistula or urethral diverticulum was detected according to the voiding cystourethrography and pelvic MRI at 1 year. One-stage LAARP is safe and effective for neonates with recto-prostatic fistula and recto-bulbar fistula. It provides an alternative method to rectify the ARMs with recto-prostatic fistula and recto-bulbar fistula without colostomy.",pubmed

                    (RB) classifiers have demonstrated effectiveness in filtering out artifacts and identifying genuine transients in real-time astronomical surveys. However, the rarity of transient events and the extensive human labeling required for a large number of samples pose significant challenges in constructing training data sets for RB classification. Given these challenges, point source injection techniques, which inject simulated point sources into optical images, provide a promising solution. This paper presents the first detailed comparison of different point source injection strategies and their effects on classification performance within a simulation-to-reality framework. To this end, we first construct various training data sets based on random injection (RI), near galaxy injection (NGI), and a combined approach by using the Korea Microlensing Telescope Network data sets. Subsequently, we train convolutional neural networks on simulated cutout samples and evaluate them on real, imbalanced data sets from gravitational wave follow-up observations for GW190814 and S230518h. Extensive experimental results show that RI excels at asteroid detection and bogus filtering but underperforms on transients occurring near galaxies (e.g., supernovae). In contrast, NGI is effective for detecting transients near galaxies but tends to misclassify variable stars as transients, resulting in a high false positive rate. The combined approach effectively handles these trade-offs, thereby balancing between detection rate and false positive rate. Our results emphasize the importance of point source injection strategy in developing robust RB classifiers for transient (or multimessenger) follow-up campaigns.

This marks a significant event as it is the first henipavirus ever reported in North America. The significance of henipaviruses lies in their ability to cause severe and often fatal diseases, such as encephalitis and respiratory illness, with a high mortality rate in both humans and animals. The emergence of new henipavirus strains, like CHV, amplifies concerns about the possibility of future zoonotic spillovers-where diseases are transmitted from animals to humans. Because henipaviruses can be highly contagious and have no specific antiviral treatment, their emergence poses a potential threat to public health. The major proteins of CHV include attachment glycoprotein, fusion protein, X protein, C protein, matrix protein, nucleocapsid protein, phosphoprotein, and RNA polymerase. In our study, we focused on determining the three-dimensional structure of these major proteins, providing crucial insights into how they function at the molecular level. Understanding the precise structure of these proteins is vital, as it can inform efforts to block the virus's ability to infect cells. Proteomic analysis confirmed that the proteins of CHV is similar to the proteins of Sollieres shrew parahenipa virus, Ninorex virus, Melian virus, Lechodon virus and Langya virus. We identified the B-cell and T-cell epitopes of these proteins. By characterizing these epitopes, our research contributes to the design of targeted vaccines that could stimulate a robust immune response against CHV. The identification of these epitopes also allows us to understand how the virus interacts with the immune system, which is essential for designing vaccines that can elicit both humoral and cellular immunity. Our study would lead to development of novel vaccines to protect against CHV.",pubmed

Traditional control methods rely heavily on chemical insecticides, leading to widespread resistance and environmental concerns. Methods: This study explores the larvicidal potential of Turritopsis dohrnii jellyfish extract as a sustainable alternative for mosquito control. The extract was tested against fourth instar Ae. aegypti larvae at concentrations ranging from 1% to 10%. Results: Mortality rates increased with both concentration and exposure time, with the highest concentration (10%) achieving 98.8% mortality after 24 hours. The LC50 value decreased from 22.50% at 2 hours to 2.06% at 24 hours, indicating increased potency over time. The results demonstrate that T. dohrnii extract is highly effective as a larvicide, with potential to reduce reliance on chemical insecticides. The findings suggest that T. dohrnii extract could be integrated into existing mosquito management programs, offering a novel and environmentally friendly approach to controlling Ae. aegypti populations. Further research is recommended to isolate the bioactive compounds responsible for this effect and to assess the extract’s efficacy under field conditions.

Here we quantitatively estimate the time it takes a porous airless body to lose all of its interior ice, based on an analytic solution for the interior temperature field of bodies in stable orbits. Without latent heat, the average surface temperature, which is lower than the classic effective temperature, is representative of the body interior and hence an appropriate temperature to evaluate desiccation timescales. In a spherically averaged model, an explicit analytic solution is obtained for the depth to ice as a function of time and the time to complete desiccation. Half of the ice volume is lost after 11% of this time. A bilobate structure emerges from the strong latitude dependence of desiccation rates. Cold polar regions can harbor subsurface ice, even when the body center does not. Latent heat retards ice loss, and we obtain a succinct expression for the temperature difference between the surface and the ice. In the outer main belt, nearly all bodies 10 km in size or larger should have been able to retain ice in their interiors over the age of the solar system. Each of the following factors favors the presence of ice inside near‐Earth objects: a semimajor axis in the outer belt or beyond, a mantle of very low thermal inertia, a young age, or a small and stable axis tilt.</jats:p>",crossref

There is an iron-rich core at the center, overlain by a silicate mantle and a crust that is generated by partial melting of the mantle. But while Mars and Venus have a core with a radius of about half the planetary radius, just as the Earth, the core of Mercury extends to about 80% of the planet’s radius. The interiors of the terrestrial planets are heated by the decay of radioactive elements and cool by removing internal energy. In addition to radiogenic heat, internal energy was deposited during planet formation and early differentiation. Heat transport is dominated by mantle and core convection and volcanic heat transfer although conduction through the lithosphere on top of the mantle matters. The convection powers the planetary heat engine which converts thermal energy into gravitational energy, mechanical (tectonic) work, and magnetic field energy. None of the terrestrial planets has plate tectonics such as the Earth although surface renewal and some form of lithosphere subduction is debated for Venus. The tectonics of Mars and Mercury is best described as stagnant-lid tectonics, with a thick rigid lid overlying the convecting mantle. Both planets show early volcanism, with Mars in particular being locally volcanically active even until a few million years ago. Because of Mercury’s large core, the mantle is comparatively thin, and convection may be sluggish or may even have ceased. Magnetism is another property that the terrestrial planets share with the Earth although it is still not confirmed by data that Venus ever had a magnetic field. A dynamo process driven by buoyancy released through the growth of a solid inner core is producing the present-day magnetic fields of Earth and Mercury, but Mars’ dynamo has likely ceased to be active. Crust units with remanent magnetization testify to the early dynamo. The terrestrial planets have been explored to differing degrees by spacecraft missions which allow a deeper physical understanding of the interiors and their dynamics and evolution.</p>",crossref

This cohort study was conducted in Pennsylvania Hospital in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and included births at the study site between August 9, 2020, and April 25, 2021. Maternal and cord blood serum samples were available for antibody level measurements for maternal-neonatal dyads. SARS-CoV-2 infection vs COVID-19 vaccination. IgG antibodies to the receptor-binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein were measured by quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Antibody concentrations and transplacental transfer ratios were measured after SARS-CoV-2 infection or receipt of COVID-19 vaccines. A total of 585 maternal-newborn dyads (median [IQR] maternal age, 31 [26-35] years; median [IQR] gestational age, 39 [38-40] weeks) with maternal IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 detected at the time of delivery were included. IgG was detected in cord blood from 557 of 585 newborns (95.2%). Among 169 vaccinated persons without SARS-CoV-2 infection, the interval from first dose of vaccine to delivery ranged from 12 to 122 days. The geometric mean IgG level among 169 vaccine recipients was significantly higher than that measured in 408 persons after infection (33.88 [95% CI, 27.64-41.53] arbitrary U/mL vs 2.80 [95% CI, 2.50-3.13] arbitrary U/mL). Geometric mean IgG levels were higher after vaccination with the mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccine compared with the BNT162b2 (Pfizer/BioNTech) vaccine (53.74 [95% CI, 40.49-71.33] arbitrary U/mL vs 25.45 [95% CI, 19.17-33.79] arbitrary U/mL; P < .001).

Time from infection or vaccination to delivery was associated with transfer ratio in models that included gestational age at delivery and maternal hypertensive disorders, diabetes, and obesity. Placental antibody transfer was detectable as early as 26 weeks' gestation. Transfer ratio that was higher than 1.0 was present for 48 of 51 (94.1%) births at 36 weeks' gestation or later by 8 weeks after vaccination. This study found that maternal and cord blood IgG antibody levels were higher after COVID-19 vaccination compared with after SARS-CoV-2 infection, with slightly lower placental transfer ratios after vaccination than after infection. The findings suggest that time from infection or vaccination to delivery was the most important factor in transfer efficiency.",pubmed

To estimate the effectiveness of the BNT162b2 vaccine in adolescents aged 12 to 18 years. This was a matched case-control study among adolescents (aged 12-18 years) who had results from a SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test. Immunization histories, relevant clinical data, and RT-PCR test results were obtained from the Yale New Haven Health System's medical records between June 1, 2021, and August 15, 2021, when the Delta variant caused 92% of infections in Connecticut. Case participants were defined as adolescents who had a positive test result and an associated medical encounter. Control participants were defined as those who had a negative test result and were matched to a case participant by age, county of residence, and date of testing. Adolescents were defined as fully immunized if they had received 2 doses of vaccine at least 14 days before focal time. The primary outcome measured was SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by RT-PCR. The vaccine's effectiveness (VE) was estimated using matched odds ratios from conditional logistic regression models. Secondary measures included estimated VE by clinical symptoms, number of vaccine doses received, and elapsed time from immunization. A total of 6901 adolescents were tested for SARS-CoV-2. The final sample comprised 186 case participants and 356 matched control participants. The median age was 14 (IQR, 13-16) years, 262 (48%) identified as female, 81 (15%) as Black, 82 (15%) as Hispanic, and 297 (55%) as White. Overall, 134 (25%) were fully immunized (case participants, 10 [5%]; control participants, 124 [35%]). The median time between immunization and the SARS-CoV-2 test was 62 days (range, 17-129 days). Within 4 months of receiving 2 doses, VE against any infection was estimated to be 91% (95% CI, 80%-96%); against asymptomatic infection, 85% (95% CI, 57%-95%).

Of 77 individuals, 47 (61.0%) were in the infection group (mean [SD] age, 29.9 [4.4] years), and 30 (39.0%) were in the vaccinated group (mean [SD] age, 33.0 [3.4] years; P = .002). The mean (SD) age of infants in the infection and vaccinated group were 3.1 (2.2) months and 7.5 (5.2) months, respectively (P < .001). Infection was associated with a variable human milk IgA and IgG receptor-binding domain-specific antibody response over time that was classified into different temporal patterns: upward trend and level trend (33 of 45 participants [73%]) and low/no response (12 of 45 participants [27%]). Infection was associated with a robust and quick IgA response in human milk that was stable out to 90 days after diagnosis. Vaccination was associated with a more uniform IgG-dominant response with concentrations increasing after each vaccine dose and beginning to decline by 90 days after the second dose. Vaccination was associated with increased human milk IgA after the first dose only (mean [SD] increase, 31.5 [32.6] antibody units). Human milk collected after infection and vaccination exhibited microneutralization activity. Microneutralization activity increased throughout time in the vaccine group only (median [IQR], 2.2 [0] before vaccine vs 10 [4.0] after the first dose; P = .003) but was higher in the infection group (median [IQR], 20 [67] at day 28) vs the vaccination group after the first-dose human milk samples (P = .002).

METHODS: Ninety-eight (98 eyes) patients with NPDR were included in this study. All participates were performed three times using Cirrus OCTA with Angiography 3×3 mm2 and 6×6 mm2 sweep mode by two examiners. The macular foveal avascular zone (FAZ) and vessel density (VD) in the superficial retinal layer (SRL) were measured. The reproducibility of the measurements was evaluated with intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) and coefficient of variation (CoV).
RESULTS: The intra-mode ICCs of Angiography 3×3 mm2 and 6×6 mm2 sweep mode were 0.957 to 0.959 and 0.964 to 0.977, respectively; and the inter-mode ICCs were 0.962 to 0.970. The intra-examiner ICCs of macular perfusion parameters were &gt;0.950; and the inter-examiner ICCs were 0.928 to 0.969. All CoVs were &lt;1.0%.
CONCLUSION: Cirrus OCTA can measure macular perfusion parameters in NPDR patients with excellent reproducibility. The measurements of FAZ and VD in the SRL determined by Angiography 3×3 mm2 and 6×6 mm2 sweep mode are highly consistent and both sweep modes are suitable for macular perfusion parameters measurement.</jats:p>",crossref

This study aimed to explore the role and mechanism of isoalantolactone in cardiomyocyte hypertrophy using angiotensin II-treated H9C2 cells as a model. The Western blot analysis was used to evaluate changes in the cardiac hypertrophy marker proteins atrial natriuretic peptide and brain natriuretic peptide and the activity of nuclear-factor erythroid 2-related factor 2/mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway. Rhodamine-phalloidin staining was used to measure the surface area of cardiomyocytes. Apoptosis and intracellular reactive oxygen species levels were measured by flow cytometry. The results showed that isoalantolactone inhibited angiotensin II-induced H9C2 cell hypertrophy and cardiomyocyte apoptosis and reduced intracellular reactive oxygen species and cytochrome C levels in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, isoalantolactone upregulated the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2/heme oxygenase-1 and inhibited extracellular signal-regulated kinase, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase, and p38 (a stress-stimulated kinase) activation. Collectively, the findings suggest that isoalantolactone can enhance the antioxidant capacity of H9C2 cells, reduce apoptosis, and inhibit cardiac hypertrophy, and these protective effects may be related to the regulation of nuclear-factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway activity by isoalantolactone.</jats:p>",crossref

               <jats:p>One of the interesting genetic conflicts between workers and queens in eusocial Hymenoptera concerns the allocation of resources to the female-and male-brood in the nest. This conflict was quantified by Trivers and Hare (1976) in a synthetic theoretical argument containing elements of sex ratio theory (Fisher 1958), kinship theory (Hamilton 1964, 1972), and parent-offspring conflict theory (Trivers 1974). They hypothesized that workers of eusocial species should capitalize on their asymmetry in relatedness towards the sexual brood by producing a female-biased sex investment ratio, whereas the fitness of the mother queen is maximized by an even sex ratio. The maximal bias expected under random mating was shown to be 3:1 and to apply to the case where colonies consist of one singly inseminated mother and full-sib worker daughters. In contrast to this relatedness-asymmetry interpretation of the sex ratios in monogynous ants, Trivers and Hare’s treatment of polygynous species’ sex ratios emphasized primarily the effect of reduced dispersal of gynes, which induces selection for male-biased sex ratios if nests recruit their own gynes as queens. Subsequent studies on polygynous Formica ants (Herbers 1979; Pamilo and Rosengren 1983, 1984; Rosengren and Pamilo 1986) revealed tremendous variation in the sex ratio of nests, both within and among populations. This reinforced a tendency either to emphasize ultimate factors other than worker kin selection for the explanation of these patterns, such as structured populations (Alexander and Sherman 1977), or to concentrate on proximate factors such as blastogenic caste determination (Schmidt 1974), or factors associated with physical and/or pheromonal queen control (Brian 1980).</jats:p>",crossref

We found a major common PS binding site at the connection of the S-protein stalk and head. The molecules of Zn-PcChol8+ and MB also form electrostatic encounter complexes with large area of negative electrostatic potential at the head of the S-protein of SARS-CoV-2, between fusion protein and heptad repeat 1 domain. The top of the SARS-CoV spike head demonstrates a notable area of electrostatic contacts with Zn-PcChol8+ and MB that corresponds to the N-terminal domain. The S-protein protomers of SARS-CoV-2 in “open” and “closed” conformations demonstrate different ability to attract PS molecules. In contrast with Zn-PcChol8+, MB possesses the ability to penetrate inside the pocket formed as a result of SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain transition into the “open” state. The existence of binding site for cationic PSs common to the S-proteins of SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and MERS-CoV creates prospects for the wide use of this type of PSs to combat the spread of coronaviruses.</jats:p>",crossref

The leading explanation in the literature is a chronic infection in immunocompromised individuals, where the virus evolves before returning into the main population. The present article reviews less-investigated hypotheses of VOC emergence with transmission between acutely infected hosts, with a focus on the mathematical models of stochastic evolution that have proved to be useful for other viruses, such as HIV and influenza virus. The central message is that understanding the acting factors of VOC evolution requires the framework of stochastic multi-locus evolution models, and that alternative hypotheses can be effectively verified by fitting results of computer simulation to empirical data.</jats:p>",crossref

Methods: the aim of this work was to study the tropism of SARS-CoV-2 for cells of freshwater fish and reptiles, including those associated with aquatic and coastal ecosystems, and the effect of ambient temperature on this process. In a continuous cell culture FHM (fathead minnow) and diploid fibroblasts CGIB (silver carp), SARS-CoV-2 replication was not maintained at either 25 °C or 29 °C. At 29 °C, the continuous cell culture TH-1 (eastern box turtle) showed high susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2, comparable to Vero E6 (development of virus-induced cytopathic effect (CPE) and an infectious titer of 7.5 ± 0.17 log10 TCID50/mL on day 3 after infection), and primary fibroblasts CNI (Nile crocodile embryo) showed moderate susceptibility (no CPE, infectious titer 4.52 ± 0.14 log10 TCID50/mL on day 5 after infection). At 25 °C, SARS-CoV-2 infection did not develop in TH-1 and CNI.

The difficult constraints that the impact origin hypothesis for SNC meteorites has to satisfy are that these meteorites are lightly to moderately shocked and yet have been accelerated to speeds in excess of the Martian escape velocity (more than 5 kilometers per second). Two-dimensional finite difference calculations were performed that show that at highly probable impact velocities (7.5 kilometers per second), vapor plume jets are produced at oblique impact angles of 25° to 60° and have speeds as great as 20 kilometers per second. These plumes flow nearly parallel to the planetary surface. It is shown that upon impact of projectiles having radii of 0.1 to 1 kilometer, the resulting vapor jets have densities of 0.1 to 1 gram per cubic centimeter.

        <p>Mucus stasis is a pathologic hallmark of muco-obstructive diseases, including cystic fibrosis (CF). Mucins, the principal component of mucus, are extensively modified with hydroxyl (O)-linked glycans, which are largely terminated by sialic acid. Sialic acid is a negatively charged monosaccharide and contributes to the biochemical/biophysical properties of mucins. Reports suggest that mucin sialylation may be altered in CF; however, the consequences of reduced sialylation on mucus clearance have not been fully determined. Here, we investigated the consequences of reduced sialylation on the charge state and conformation of the most prominent airway mucin, MUC5B, and defined the functional consequences of reduced sialylation on mucociliary transport (MCT). Reduced sialylation contributed to a lower charged MUC5B form and decreased polymer expansion. The inhibition of total mucin sialylation <italic>de novo</italic> impaired MCT in primary human bronchial epithelial cells and rat airways, and specific α-2,3 sialylation blockade was sufficient to recapitulate these findings. Finally, we show that ST3 beta-galactoside alpha-2,3-sialyltransferase (ST3Gal1) expression is downregulated in CF and partially restored by correcting CFTR via Elexacaftor/Tezacaftor/Ivacaftor treatment. Overall, this study demonstrates the importance of mucin sialylation in mucus clearance and identifies decreased sialylation by ST3Gal1 as a possible therapeutic target in CF and potentially other muco-obstructive diseases.</p>",crossref

AD is the most common etiology that causes dementia in mid- and late life. The prototypical clinical presentation is that of a gradually worsening problem with learning new information, that is, a short-term memory deficit, accompanied by cognitive impairment in other domains, including language, spatial cognition, and executive functioning, as well as changes in personality and behavior. A key element of the diagnosis of dementia is that daily functioning is impaired. The concept of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) as the earliest symptomatic presentation of a dementing illness is now widely accepted. MCI due to AD typically presents with isolated problems with learning and memory without substantial loss of ability to function in daily life.  Less common variants of AD are now recognized and include a disorder in which spatial and visual cognitive dysfunction occurs or in which word-finding problems predominate at the onset of symptoms. Although AD as a cause of dementia is the most common among etiologies, AD often co-occurs with other neurodegenerative diseases and with cerebrovascular disease. The presence of multietiology dementia in which AD is a contributor is particularly common in the eighth decade of life and beyond.

However, broad validation of the sex-specific GRACE 3.0 in-hospital mortality model, and corresponding models for predicting long-term mortality and the personalised effect of early invasive management, are still needed. We used data of 609 063 patients with NSTE-ACS from ten countries between Jan 1, 2005, and June 24, 2024. A machine learning model for 1-year mortality was developed in 400 054 patients from England, Wales, and Northern Ireland. Both the in-hospital mortality model and the new 1-year mortality model were externally validated in patients from Sweden, Switzerland, Germany, Denmark, Spain, the Netherlands, and Czechia. A separate machine learning model to predict the individualised effect of early versus delayed invasive coronary angiography and revascularisation on a composite primary outcome of all-cause death, non-fatal recurrent myocardial infarction, hospital admission for refractory myocardial ischaemia, or hospital admission for heart failure at a median follow-up of 4·3 years was developed and externally validated in participants from geographically different sets of hospitals in the Danish VERDICT trial. The in-hospital mortality model (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC] 0·90, 95% CI 0·89-0·91) and the 1-year mortality model (time-dependent AUC 0·84, 95% CI 0·82-0·86) showed excellent discriminative abilities on external validation across all countries. Both models were well calibrated and decision curve analyses suggested favourable clinical utility. Compared with score version 2.0, both models provided improved discrimination and risk reclassification. The individualised treatment effect model effectively identified patients who would benefit from early invasive management on external validation. Patients with high predicted benefit had reduced risk of the composite outcome when randomly assigned to early invasive management (hazard ratio 0·60, 95% CI 0·41-0·88), whereas patients with no-to-moderate predicted benefit did not (1·06, 0·80-1·40; pinteraction=0·014). The individualised treatment effect model suggested that the group of patients with NSTE-ACS who benefit from early intervention might be incompletely captured by current treatment strategies. The updated GRACE 3.0 scoring system provides a validated, practical tool to support personalised risk assessment in patients with NSTE-ACS.

However, imaging cerebral small vessels themselves in vivo remains costly and challenging. There is growing interest in investigating whether retinal microvascular imaging features could be proxies for changes in the brain microvasculature. Using a multipronged approach, we explored the relation of retinal microvascular characteristics with MRI markers of cSVD (MRI-cSVD). First, we explored this relationship in older community persons from the population-based 3C-Dijon cohort. MRI-cSVD was assessed on a 1.5-Tesla MRI at baseline, comprising white matter hyperintensity volume (WMHV), lacunes, and a composite extreme cSVD phenotype (WMHV extreme distributions and presence/absence of lacunes). At 10-year follow-up, participants underwent measurements of retinal microvascular features on fundus using the Singapore ""I"" Vessel Assessment software. To support 3C-Dijon findings, we conducted a comprehensive literature review up to July 2024 from PubMed/EMBASE and used 2-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) leveraging large-scale genome-wide association studies, to assess causality and directionality. In 670 3C-Dijon participants (median age 70.7, 65.7% women), multivariable analyses (adjusted for age, sex, axial length, and cardiovascular risk factors) showed a significant association of lower arteriolar fractal dimension (FDa) with extreme cSVD (odds ratio [OR] 1.68, 95% CI 1.20-2.34) after multiple testing correction (p< 0.0042), and atp< 0.05, associations of lower FDa and smaller arteriolar caliber with larger WMHV (β = 0.0534 [95% CI 0.0075-0.0569] and 0.0519 [95% CI 0.0045-0.0993]), and of greater venular tortuosity (TORTv) with lacunes (OR 1.45, 95% CI 1.05-2.00). Lower FDa was also associated with poorer executive function. The systematic review of the literature identified 12 studies (N = 7,796) that showed mostly consistent direction of effects for FDa (5/6 studies), TORTv (4/6), and arteriolar caliber (10/11), although statistical significance was observed in 5 individual studies only. Two-sample MR based on large genome-wide association studies (N = 5,292-52,798) showed evidence for a potentially causal association of greater TORTv with extreme cSVD and larger WMHV (p= 0.0017 and 0.049), with no evidence for reverse causation. We provide multimodal evidence that geometric characteristics of the retinal microvasculature are associated with increased burden of MRI-cSVD and possibly worse executive function.",pubmed

We established an amended LVA protocol to mitigate the risk of venous reflux, a prevalent issue associated with the original LVA methodology. A 64-year-old man of Chinese descent exhibited the typical signs and symptoms of AD. The absence of substantial progress with standard medical treatment led to the consideration of LVA. We used a lower limb vein graft for the LVA, anastomosing it to the cervical lymphatic vessels and external jugular vein. The cognitive function of the patient got better after LVA, as shown by higher Mini Mental State Examination and Montreal Cognitive Assessment scores. Fewer β-amyloid and tau protein deposits were observed on positron emission tomography/computed tomography scans. No adverse occurrences or issues were observed. The success in this case demonstrated the potential role of LVA in the management of AD. However, further thorough research is required to evaluate the efficacy of our technique.",pubmed

The space density of luminous galaxies has been shown to decrease by 15–20× over 4&lt;z&lt;8. Over this same redshift interval, the faint-end slope of the UV luminosity function becomes steeper (α≃−2.0 at z≃7−8), revealing a dominant population of low-luminosity galaxies. Analysis of multiwavelength imaging from HST and the Spitzer Space Telescope demonstrates that z&gt;6 UV-selected galaxies are relatively compact with blue UV continuum slopes, low stellar masses, and large specific star formation rates. In the last year, ALMA (the Atacama Large Millimeter Array) and ground-based infrared spectrographs have begun to complement this picture, revealing minimal dust obscuration and hard radiation fields, and providing evidence for metal-poor ionized gas. Weak low-ionization absorption lines suggest a patchy distribution of neutral gas surrounds O and B stars, possibly aiding in the escape of ionizing radiation. Gamma ray burst afterglows and Lyman-α surveys have provided evidence that the intergalactic medium (IGM) evolves from mostly ionized at z≃6−6.5 ([Formula: see text]) to considerably neutral at z≃7−8 ([Formula: see text]). The reionization history that emerges from considering the UV output of galaxies over 6&lt;z&lt;10 is consistent with these constraints on the IGM ionization state. The latest measurements suggest that galaxies can complete reionization by z≃6 and reproduce the Thomson scattering optical depth faced by cosmic microwave background photons if the luminosity function extends ≃4 mag below current surveys and a moderate fraction ([Formula: see text]) of ionizing radiation escapes from galaxies. </jats:p>",crossref

However, it remains unknown how soon after the Big Bang massive starburst progenitors exist. The measured redshift (z) distribution of dusty, massive starbursts has long been suspected to be biased low in z owing to selection effects, as confirmed by recent findings of systems with redshifts as high as ~5 (refs 2-4). Here we report the identification of a massive starburst galaxy at z = 6.34 through a submillimetre colour-selection technique. We unambiguously determined the redshift from a suite of molecular and atomic fine-structure cooling lines. These measurements reveal a hundred billion solar masses of highly excited, chemically evolved interstellar medium in this galaxy, which constitutes at least 40 per cent of the baryonic mass. A 'maximum starburst' converts the gas into stars at a rate more than 2,000 times that of the Milky Way, a rate among the highest observed at any epoch. Despite the overall downturn in cosmic star formation towards the highest redshifts, it seems that environments mature enough to form the most massive, intense starbursts existed at least as early as 880 million years after the Big Bang.",pubmed

These are widely interpreted as relics from the early Universe, when all gas possessed a primordial chemistry. Before now there have been no direct abundance measurements from the first billion years after the Big Bang, when the earliest stars began synthesizing elements. Here we report observations of hydrogen and heavy-element absorption in a spectrum of a quasar at z =  7.04, when the Universe was just 772 million years old (5.6 per cent of its present age). We detect a large column of neutral hydrogen but no corresponding metals (defined as elements heavier than helium), limiting the chemical abundance to less than 1/10,000 times the solar level if the gas is in a gravitationally bound proto-galaxy, or to less than 1/1,000 times the solar value if it is diffuse and unbound. If the absorption is truly intergalactic, it would imply that the Universe was neither ionized by starlight nor chemically enriched in this neighbourhood at z ≈ 7. If it is gravitationally bound, the inferred abundance is too low to promote efficient cooling, and the system would be a viable site to form the predicted but as yet unobserved massive population III stars.",pubmed

These findings have prompted the development of several theoretical models for the early formation and growth of black holes, which are, however, difficult to differentiate. We report the metallicity measurement around a gravitationally lensed massive black hole at redshift 7.04 (classified as a Little Red Dot), hosted in a galaxy with very low dynamical mass. The weakness of the [OIII]5007 emission line relative to the narrow H$β$ emission indicates extremely low metallicity, about $4\times 10^{-2}$ solar, and even more metal poor in the surrounding few 100 pc. We argue that such properties cannot be uncommon among accreting black holes around this early cosmic epoch. Explaining such a low chemical enrichment in a system that has developed a massive black hole is challenging for most theories. Models assuming heavy black hole seeds (such as Direct Collapse Black Holes) or super-Eddington accretion scenarios struggle to explain the observations, although they can potentially reproduce the observed properties in some cases. Models invoking ""primordial black holes"" (i.e. putative black holes formed shortly after the Big Bang) may potentially explain the low chemical enrichment associated with this black hole, although this class of models also requires further developments for proper testing.",nasa_ads

We demonstrate, using a novel machine learning technique, how combining upper limits on the spatial fluctuations in the 21-cm signal with observations of the sky-averaged 21-cm signal from neutral hydrogen can improve our understanding of this epoch. By jointly analysing data from the Shaped Antenna measurement of the background RAdio Spectrum (SARAS3, redshift z ≈ 15-25) and limits from the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA, z ≈ 8 and 10), we show that such a synergetic analysis provides tighter constraints on the astrophysics of galaxies 200 million years after the big bang than can be achieved with the individual data sets. Although our constraints are weak, this is the first time data from a sky-averaged 21-cm experiment and power spectrum experiment have been analysed together. In synergy, the two experiments leave only $64.9^{+0.3}_{-0.1}$ per cent of the explored broad theoretical parameter space to be consistent with the joint data set, in comparison to $92.3^{+0.3}_{-0.1}$ per cent for SARAS3 and $79.0^{+0.5}_{-0.2}$ per cent for HERA alone. We use the joint analysis to constrain star formation efficiency, minimum halo mass for star formation, X-ray luminosity of early emitters, and the radio luminosity of early galaxies. The joint analysis disfavours at 68 per cent confidence a combination of galaxies with X-ray emission that is ≲33 and radio emission that is ≳32 times as efficient as present day galaxies.

The goal of the paper was to verify triggering of earthquakes by the length of day variations, i.e. the sidereal 13.66 days Earth's rotation variations, in contrast with tidal biweekly 14.76 days variations (full and new Moon), which for hundred years of investigation give negative results. Earthquake triggering governed by sidereal variations caused by variable Moon's declination accelerates and decelerates the Earth's rotation. Profound Schuster's test proved that earthquakes are triggered both in Earth's deceleration and acceleration. For this investigation the most prominent earthquakes from 2010–2011 were used from Mid-Atlantic Ridge, Southeast Indian Ridge, Sumatra and Andaman Sea, Chile trench, Haiti and Honshu region including important older earthquakes of Sumatra 26 December 2004 and Denali Fault 3 November 2002. Dominant number of earthquake occurring in extremes of length of day variations initiated the calculation of forces acting in these time intervals. Calculated forces of tidal force acting on Earth's flattening and the westward drift are strong enough to trigger earthquakes and the movement of plates follows from GPS performed immediately after earthquakes on continents and from increased number of earthquakes of the side of the mid-ocean ridge belonging to the moving plate. Generally the Northern Hemisphere moves quicker westward than the Southern one. Earthquakes are repeated in 19 yr Metonic cycle. Repetitions caused by tidal force acting on Earth's fattening are exact in date. Repetitions caused by westward drift are delayed for several months.</jats:p>",crossref

               <jats:p>In star clusters, close stellar encounters can strongly impact the architecture of a planetary system or even destroy it. We present a systematic study of the effects of stellar flybys on two-planet systems. When such a system experiences flybys, one or both planets can be ejected, forming free-floating planets (FFPs), captured planets (CPs) around the flyby star, and free-floating binary planets (BPs); the remaining single-surviving planets (SSPs) can have their orbital radii and eccentricities greatly changed. Through numerical experiments, we calculate the formation fractions (or branching ratios) of FFPs, SSPs, CPs, and BPs as a function of the pericenter distance of the flyby, and use them to derive analytical expressions for the formation rates of FFPs, SSPs, CPs and BPs in general cluster environments. We find that the production rates of FFPs and SSPs are similar (for the initial planet semimajor axis ratio <jats:italic>a</jats:italic>

Given the need for dust exposure protection in future lunar base construction and resource development, this study established an acute exposure model using lunar soil simulant (LSS) and used Earth soil (ES; Loess from Shaanxi, China) as a comparison to investigate lung injury mechanisms. C57BL/6 mice were randomly assigned to 3 groups: Phosphate buffered saline (PBS), LSS, and ES, with 5 to 7 mice per group. Mice in the LSS and ES groups received a single intratracheal instillation to induce acute inhalation exposure. Body weight was monitored for 28 days. Mice were euthanized at days 3, 7, 14, and 28 post-exposure, and peripheral blood, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), and lung tissues were collected. Immune cell subsets in BALF were analyzed using flow cytometry. Hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining assessed lung structure and inflammation; periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) staining evaluated airway mucus secretion; Masson staining examined collagen deposition. Real-time reverse transcription PCR (real-time RT-PCR) was used to measure the mRNA expression of inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β,IL-6, andTNF-α) and epithelial barrier genes (Occludin,Cadherin-1, andZo-1). Lung tissues at day 7 were subjected to transcriptomic sequencing, followed by immune infiltration and pathway enrichment analyses to determine immunoregulatory mechanisms. Body weight in the ES group progressively declined after day 18 (allP<0.05), while the LSS group showed no significant changes compared with the control group. HE staining showed both LSS and ES induced inflammatory cell infiltration around airways and vasculature, which persisted for 28 days but gradually lessened over time. PAS staining revealed marked mucus hypersecretion in the LSS group at day 3, followed by gradual recovery; no significant mucus changes were observed in the ES group. Masson staining indicated no obvious pulmonary fibrosis in either group within 28 days. Real-time RT-PCR demonstrated significant upregulation ofIL-1βandTNF-αin both LSS and ES groups, peaking on day 7, accompanied by downregulation of epithelial barrier genes (Occludin,Cadherin-1, andZo-1)(allP<0.05). Transcriptomic analysis showed that both LSS and ES activated chemokine-related pathways and enriched leukocyte migration and neutrophil recruitment pathways. Further validation revealed upregulation ofCXCL2andMMP12in the LSS group, whereasCXCL3andMMP12were predominantly elevated in the ES group. Both LSS and ES can induce sustained lung injury and neutrophil infiltration in mice, though the underlying molecular mechanisms differ. Compared with ES, exposure to LSS additionally triggers a transient eosinophilic response, suggesting that lunar dust particles possess stronger immunostimulatory potential and higher biological toxicity. 目的: 月球表面尘埃因长期受宇宙辐射及陨石撞击作用的影响，形成具有高静电吸附特性的纳米级棱角结构，这些尘埃具有吸入风险，但其对肺部的毒理机制尚不清楚。针对月球基地建设和资源开发过程中的粉尘暴露防护需求，本研究通过构建月球土壤模拟物(lunar soil simulant，LSS)急性暴露模型，并以地球土壤(Earth soil，ES;陕西黄土)为对照，旨在探究粉尘吸入对肺损伤的作用机制。方法: 将C57BL/6小鼠随机分为3组:磷酸盐缓冲液(phosphate buffered saline，PBS)组、LSS组和ES组，每组5~7只小鼠。LSS组和ES组分别使用LSS和ES建立急性吸入模型，采用单次呛咳法进行暴露。实验过程中动态监测小鼠体重变化，持续28 d，并于暴露后第3、7、14、28天分批处死小鼠取材，采集外周血、肺泡灌洗液(bronchoalveolar lavage fluid，BALF)及肺组织样本。通过流式细胞术分析BALF中免疫细胞亚群的动态变化;采用HE染色评估肺组织结构及炎症程度，过碘酸-雪夫(periodic acid-Schiff，PAS)染色评估气道黏液分泌，Masson染色判断胶原沉积情况。通过实时反转录聚合酶链反应(real-time reverse transcription PCR，real-time RT-PCR)检测炎症因子(IL-1β、IL-6、TNF-α)及上皮屏障相关基因(Occludin、Cadherin-1、Zo-1)的mRNA表达水平。选取暴露后第7天的肺组织样本进行转录组学测序，并结合免疫浸润分析和功能通路富集分析，探讨LSS和ES对肺部免疫微环境的调控效应。结果: ES组小鼠在暴露18 d后体重逐渐下降(均P<0.05)，而LSS组小鼠的体重与PBS组的差异无统计学意义。HE染色结果显示:LSS与ES均可诱发气道及血管周围的炎症细胞浸润，且炎症反应在28 d内持续存在，但随着时间延长有逐渐减轻的趋势。PAS染色提示LSS组小鼠在第3天出现明显的气道黏液分泌增加，之后逐渐恢复;ES组未见显著变化。Masson染色结果未见LSS组或ES组在28 d内出现明显的肺纤维化改变。Real-time RT-PCR结果显示:LSS和ES处理均可显著上调肺组织中IL-1β及TNF-α的表达，尤其在暴露第7天时炎症反应最为显著，同时伴随Occludin、Cadherin-1、Zo-1等上皮屏障标志基因表达下调(均P<0.05)。转录组分析结果显示:LSS与ES处理均显著激活与趋化因子相关的通路，富集到多条白细胞迁移、中性粒细胞募集等免疫相关通路。进一步验证发现LSS组肺组织中CXCL2及MMP12表达上调;ES组则以CXCL3及MMP12表达上调为主。结论: LSS和ES均可诱导小鼠持续性肺损伤和中性粒细胞浸润，但所依赖的分子机制存在差异。与ES相比，LSS暴露还会引发短暂的嗜酸性粒细胞应答，提示LSS颗粒具有更强的免疫激活潜能和生物毒性。.",pubmed

However, the biological effects of LD exposure through the digestive system remain poorly understood. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of digestive exposure to lunar dust simulant (LDS) on gut microbiota and on the intestine, liver, kidney, lung, and bone in mice. Eight-week-old female C57BL/6J mice were used. LDS was used as a substitute for lunar dust, and Shaanxi loess was used as Earth dust (ED). Mice were randomly divided into a phosphate buffered saline (PBS) group, an ED group (500 mg/kg), and a LDS group (500 mg/kg), with assessments at days 7, 14, and 28. Mice were gavaged once every 3 days, with body weight recorded before each gavage. At sacrifice, fecal samples were analyzed by 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequencing; inflammatory cytokine expression [interleukin (IL)-1β,IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α)] in intestinal, liver, and lung tissues was measured by real-time reverse transcription PCR (real-time RT-PCR); hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining was performed on lung, liver, and intestinal tissues; Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) staining was used to assess the integrity of the intestinal mucus barrier, and immunohistochemical staining was performed to evaluate the expression of mucin-2 (MUC2). Serum biochemical tests assessed hepatic and renal function. Femoral bone mass was analyzed by micro-computed tomography (micro-CT); osteoblasts and osteoclasts were assessed by osteocalcin (OCN) and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining. Bone marrow immune cell subsets were analyzed by flow cytometry. At day 10, weight gain was slowed in ED and LDS groups. At days 22 and 28, body weight in both ED and LDS groups was significantly lower than controls (bothP<0.05). LDS exposure increased microbial species richness and diversity at day 7. Compared with the PBS and ED groups, mice in the LDS group showed increased relative abundance of Deferribacterota, Desulfobacterota, and Campylobacterota, and decreased Firmicutes, with increasedHelicobacter typhloniusand reducedLactobacillus johnsoniiandLactobacillusmurinus. HE and PAS staining of the colon showed that mucosal structural disruption and goblet cell loss were more severe in the LDS group. In addition, immunohistochemistry revealed a significant downregulation of MUC2 expression in this group (P<0.05). No obvious pathological alterations were observed in liver HE staining among the 3 groups, and none of the groups exhibited notable hepatic or renal dysfunction. HE staining of the lungs in the ED and LDS groups showed increased perivascular inflammatory cell infiltration (bothP<0.05). LDS exposure via the digestive route induces gut dysbiosis, intestinal barrier disruption, pulmonary inflammation, bone loss, and bone marrow immune imbalance. These findings indicate that LD exposure poses potential health risks during future lunar missions. Targeted restoration of beneficial gut microbiota may represent a promising strategy to mitigate LD-related health hazards. 目的: 早在阿波罗11号任务中，宇航员携带月尘(lunar dust，LD)进入返回舱后出现眼部、皮肤和上呼吸道刺激症状，这引起了人们对其潜在生物毒性的关注。然而，LD通过消化系统暴露所造成的影响尚缺乏研究。本研究旨在评估月尘模拟物(lunar dust simulant，LDS)经消化系统暴露对小鼠肠道菌群、肠道、肝、肾、肺及骨骼造成的影响。方法: 以8周龄C57BL/6J雌性小鼠为研究对象，使用LDS代替LD，选择陕西黄土代表地尘(Earth dust，ED)。将小鼠随机分成磷酸盐缓冲液(phosphate buffered saline，PBS)组、ED组(500 mg/kg)和LDS组(500 mg/kg)，设置第7、14和28天3个暴露时长。每3 d灌胃1次，每次灌胃前称量小鼠体重。在干预结束后，采用16S核糖体RNA(ribosomal RNA，rRNA)测序技术分析小鼠粪便中肠道微生物多样性和组成;采用实时反转录聚合酶链反应(real-time reverse transcription PCR，real-time RT-PCR)检测肠道、肝、肺组织中炎症因子白细胞介素(interleukin，IL)-1β、IL-6和肿瘤坏死因子(tumor necrosis factor，TNF)-α的mRNA表达水平;采用苏木精-伊红(hematoxylin and eosin，HE)染色观察小鼠肺、肝和肠道的病理改变;采用糖原过碘酸-雪夫(periodic acid-Schiff，PAS)染色评估肠道黏膜屏障完整性，免疫组织化学染色检测黏蛋白2(mucin 2，MUC2)的表达情况;采集小鼠血液检测肝肾功能;采用微计算机断层扫描(micro-computed tomography，micro-CT)检测小鼠股骨骨量，免疫组织化学染色进行骨钙素(osteocalcin，OCN)染色来检测成骨细胞数目，抗酒石酸酸性磷酸酶(tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase，TRAP)染色检测破骨细胞数目;采用流式细胞术检测小鼠骨髓中免疫细胞的比例。结果: 在暴露第10天，ED组和LDS组小鼠体重增长减缓，第22天和第28天时ED组和LDS组小鼠体重均明显低于PBS组(均P<0.05)。16S rRNA测序结果显示，在暴露第7天，LDS组小鼠粪便微生物物种丰富度和多样性均高于PBS组;与PBS组和ED组相比，LDS组小鼠粪便中脱铁杆菌门、脱硫弧菌门、弯曲菌门相对丰度升高，厚壁菌门相对丰度降低，其中盲肠螺杆菌的比例升高，约氏乳杆菌和鼠乳杆菌的比例降低。结肠HE与PAS染色结果显示LDS组黏膜结构破坏和杯状细胞减少更为严重;此外，免疫组化结果显示其MUC2表达也显著下调(P<0.05)。3组小鼠的肝脏HE染色结果均未见明显病理改变，且均无明显肝肾功能损伤。ED组和LDS组肺HE染色结果显示肺血管周围炎症细胞浸润增多。Real-time RT-PCR结果显示LDS组小鼠肺组织和肠道的炎症因子表达水平相较PBS组明显升高。Micro-CT结果显示，在暴露第28天，ED组和LDS组小鼠骨量较PBS组明显减低。免疫组织化学染色结果显示，ED组和LDS组小鼠成骨细胞减少，破骨细胞增加。流式细胞术结果显示LDS暴露第7天和第28天骨髓中巨噬细胞的比例较PBS组均明显降低(均P<0.05)。结论: LDS可引起肠道有益菌丢失和有害菌增加、肠道屏障损伤，以及肺部炎症反应、骨量丢失和骨髓免疫失衡。因此，在未来的月球任务中，应高度重视LD对健康的潜在危害;靶向补充有益菌以预防LD暴露所致的健康危害，或可成为一种具有应用前景的干预策略。.",pubmed

Satellite remote sensing provides a cost-effective method to monitor chlorophyll-a (chl-a), a common proxy for algal biomass; however, the dynamic nature of rivers complicates approaches traditionally applied to lakes and oceans. During 2021-2023, we collected discrete samples for laboratory measurement of chl-a and measured in situ chl-a fluorescence during a series of longitudinal boat surveys along a 220-km reach of the lower Hudson River. Surveys were timed to coincide with Sentinel-2 satellite overpasses. We first investigated relations between laboratory-measured chl-a concentration and field-measured chl-a fluorescence, observing a weak correlation (r2= 0.25) that improved substantially after splitting data by day (mean r2= 0.53). Separately, to estimate chl-a fluorescence using satellite data, we developed a series of random forest models leveraging the rich fluorescence dataset collected. We tested three model types: individual day models, leave-one-out models trained on all days except a holdout test day, and a single pooled model trained on all days. Generally, individual day models exhibited lowest error (mean of mean absolute error [MAE] = 0.16 relative fluorescence units [RFU]), followed by the single pooled model (MAE = 0.22 RFU). Daily holdout models showed highest error (mean MAE = 0.40 RFU); this approach was intended to represent model performance on a day unseen in the training set, providing a more conservative estimate of performance than the more traditional pooled approach. Findings from both analyses emphasize the importance of considering temporal variability when modeling riverine systems.",pubmed

This legislation partly aims to increase production of Critical Raw Materials (CRMs) from waste streams, with many CRMs being elements with which the water sector has decades of experience, such as the notorious contaminant and newly classified CRM, arsenic. In thisPerspective, we use arsenic as a case study to explore how water treatment waste can be repurposed to contribute to CRM supply chain requirements. Combining arsenic mass balances for indicative groundwater treatment plants and EU statistics of water use and arsenic compound consumption, we propose that arsenic upcycling integrated with water treatment can help offset imports of arsenic compounds. However, research is now needed to develop more holistic treatment systems that integrate CRM upcycling with contaminant removal and to better understand the political, institutional, and social drivers that can accelerate adoption of such systems at water utilities. With this work, we intend to stimulate a discussion of water treatment as a discipline that can both improve water quality by removing metal(loid) contaminants and generate local sources of CRMs.",pubmed

Biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) is the dominant natural nitrogen source to the terrestrial biosphere and can alleviate nitrogen limitation but is poorly constrained in Earth system models (ESMs). Here, we compare terrestrial BNF from an ensemble of ESMs of the 6th Coupled Model Intercomparison Project to a new global synthesis of observations across natural and agricultural biomes. We find that compared to observations, ESMs underestimate agricultural BNF but overestimate natural BNF in the present day by over 50%. Natural BNF is overestimated in the most productive ecosystems that contribute most to the terrestrial carbon sink (forests and grasslands). ESMs with different BNF representations yield a range of BNF responses to CO2enrichment. Some ESMs with phenomenological representations of BNF predict a natural BNF increase in response to a doubling of CO2that aligns with a meta-analysis of CO2enrichment experiments (31% increase) but fail to account for the substantial carbon cost of BNF. In contrast, ESMs with mechanistic representations of BNF account for its carbon cost as well as its regulation by nitrogen limitation but overestimate the BNF response to a doubling of CO2(135% increase). Overall, all current BNF representations in ESMs fall short of fully capturing its response to rising atmospheric CO2. Finally, we find a positive correlation between modeled present-day natural BNF and the CO2fertilization effect across ESMs, suggesting that overestimated natural BNF translates to an exaggerated CO2fertilization effect of approximately 11% in ESMs.",pubmed

        <p>ORF10 is a small open reading frame at the 3' end of the SARS-CoV-2 genome, often dismissed as non-functional due to its lack of confirmed protein expression and frequent truncations in some lineages. However, large-scale genomic evidence for its evolutionary constraint remains limited and until now, no study has systematically mapped co-mutation patterns across millions of sequences. We analyzed 9,356,279 high-quality SARS-CoV-2 genomes to assess the integrity of the ORF10 coding region (positions 29558–29674). Using streaming bioinformatics, we identified co-occurring mutations without full decompression of the data. To evaluate selective pressure, we calculated the pN/pS ratio the proportion of variable non-synonymous sites relative to synonymous sites a more robust metric than dN/dS for low-diversity regions like ORF10. Of the 9.36 million sequences analyzed, 9,105,582 (97.3%) preserved a full-length ORF10 region, indicating exceptional conservation. We observed structured co-mutation patterns, including a dual insertion (29611:-&gt;T, 29612:-&gt;G) present in over 244,000 sequences and detected in 9 countries. The pN/pS ratio was 0.32, well below 1, suggesting strong purifying selection. Traditional dN/dS could not be reliably estimated due to low synonymous variation and ambiguous base calls (e.g., 'N'), but the near-universal preservation of the ORF10 reading frame provides compelling evidence of evolutionary constraint. The scale and consistency of ORF10 conservation across global sequences challenge the assumption that it is entirely dispensable. While we cannot confirm protein expression from genomic data alone, the strong signal of purifying selection reflected in both pN/pS and the rarity of disruptive mutations suggests that ORF10, or its overlapping genomic elements, may play a functional role. Rather than dismissing it as junk, we should keep investigating.</p>",crossref

        <jats:p><jats:underline>Background:</jats:underline> Despite an abundance of information on the risk factors of SARS-CoV-2, large scale studies of long-term effects are lacking. In this paper we analyzed a large medical claims database of US based individuals to identify common long-term effects as well as their associations with various social and medical risk factors.<jats:underline>Methods:</jats:underline> The medical claims database was obtained from a prominent US based claims data processing company, namely Change Healthcare. In addition to the claims data, the dataset also consisted of various social determinants of health such as race, income, education level and veteran status of the individuals. A self-controlled cohort design (SCCD) observational study was performed to identify ICD-10 codes whose proportion was significantly increased in the outcome period compared to the control period to identify significant long-term effects. A logistic regression-based association analysis was then performed between identified long-term effects and social determinants of health.<jats:underline>Results:</jats:underline> Among the over 1.37 million COVID patients in our datasets we found 36 out of 1,724 3-digit ICD-10 codes to be statistically significantly increased in the post-COVID period (p-value &lt;0.05). We also found one combination of ICD-10 codes, corresponding to ‘other anemias’ and ‘hypertension’, that was statistically significantly increased in the post-COVID period (p-value &lt;0.05). Our logistic regression-based association analysis with social determinants of health variables, after adjusting for comorbidities and prior conditions, showed that age and gender were significantly associated with the multiple long-term effects. Race was only associated with ‘other sepsis’, income was only associated with ‘Alopecia areata’, while education level was only associated with ‘Maternal infectious and parasitic diseases’ (p-value &lt;0.05). Conclusion: We identified several long-term effects of SARS-CoV-2 through a self-controlled study on a cohort of over one million patients. Furthermore, we found that while age and gender are commonly associated with the long-term effects, other social determinants of health such as race, income and education levels have rare or no significant associations.</jats:p>",crossref

About 76% of patients with long COVID experience neurological manifestations. Moreover, patients who have survived COVID-19 have an increased risk of cerebral venous thrombosis. This case report describes a 41-year-old woman who developed neurological manifestations associated with jugular vein thrombosis 24 h after administration of the Oxford-AstraZeneca (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) vaccine (AstraZeneca-Serum Institute of India). She had been infected with SARS-CoV-2 three months before vaccination. Although initially suspected to be a case of vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) in view of her recent vaccination, the patient did not have any hallmarks of VITT, such as thrombocytopenia, an increased d-dimer level, or antibodies against platelet factor-4. Moreover, the neurological manifestations were associated with a high concentration of inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-6, IL-17A, and IL-21, and elevated neutrophil levels in cerebrospinal fluid, suggesting that inflammatory immune components had a role in the development of thrombotic events and pointing to an alternative diagnosis. In this case, the laboratory results indicated that the neurological manifestations associated with jugular vein thrombosis were not associated with VITT. Therefore, we propose that the thrombosis of the left jugular vein was a sequela of SARS-CoV-2 infection.",pubmed

SRC_302,"Perceptions of Body Condition, Diet and Exercise by Sports Dog Owners and Pet Dog Owners","Heidi A. Kluess, Rebecca L. Jones, Tekla Lee-Fowler",2021,Animals,10.3390/ani11061752,https://doi.org/10.3390/ani11061752,"<jats:p>The purpose of this study was to investigate the variables that contribute to obesity in pet dogs. The working hypothesis was that sports dog owners will better estimate their dog’s body condition and report stronger belief and control over their dogs’ feeding and exercise compared to traditional pet owners. We collected data on 171 pet owners (101 participated in canine sports) for this study. Each owner completed the Dog Owner Attitude Questionnaire. Each dog was measured for percent fat and Purina body condition scale. For the pet dogs, the median Purina body condition score was 6 (too heavy), but for the sports dogs it was 5 (ideal) (p &lt; 0.05 different from pet dogs). The average percent fat for the pet dogs was 19.1 ± 8.6%, and for the sports dogs it was 13.8 ± 5.3% (p &lt; 0.05 different from pet dogs). Among pet owners, 52% were able to correctly estimate their dog’s body condition. Sports dog owners were 57% correct. Pet dog owners fed approximately 60% more per day compared to sports dog owners. Pet and sports dog owners exercised their dog via walking, but sports dog owners reported more activity with the dog, while pet dog owners reported more activity than the dog did by themselves. Overall, pet and sports dog owners put a high value on their dog’s health and well-being, but better education with regard to body condition, feeding and exercise is critical to improve the pet obesity problem.</jats:p>",crossref
